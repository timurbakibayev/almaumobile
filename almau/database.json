Consumer behavior is the study of the processes involved when individuals \nor groups select, purchase, use, or dispose of products, services, ideas, or experiences to satisfy needs \nand desires (Solomon, Russell-Bennett and Previte, 2013). Why should managers, advertisers or other \nmarketing professionals study consumer behavior? Very simply, understanding consumer behavior \nmakes good business sense. The marketing concept asserts that organisations need to satisfy the needs of \nconsumers if they are to survive and thrive in today\u2019s world. Marketers can only satisfy these needs to the \nextent that they understand the people, or organisations, that will use the products and services they sell.\n\nThe consumer decision-making process is examined in this chapter. All stages in the process are key \nto integrated marketing communications (IMC). Integrated Marketing Communications is defined by \nAng (2014: p. 4) as follows:\n\n\u201cIMC is defined as a research-based, audience-focused, result-driven, communication planning \nprocess that aims to execute a brand communication program over time so that thre is clairy \nand conistency in the positioning of the brand. This is achieved by coordinating different \ncommunication disciplines and integrating the creative content across different media. The \nultimate aim is to achieve short-term financial gain and long-term brand equity\u201d.\n\nFor instance, an effective IMC campaign targets potential buyers involved in these processes and seeks \nto present a particular product or brand as a solution to the customer\u2019s problem. Persuasive marketing \ncommunications can lead the customer from problem recognition to purchase and good marketing can \nfoster customer satisfaction and brand loyalty. Customer attitudes, values and cognition are examined \nin this chapter. A review of the trends present in the marketing environment is also provided.\n\nThe following case study highlights the importance of understanding consumer behaviour.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n10 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\n2  Case Study: virtual smoking \nand apps \u2013 the new frontier \nof cigarette marketing \ncommunications?\n\nA simple buying decision is made every day by a large number of Australians and this decision is to buy \ncigarettes. Why do they do it? Some individuals would say that it simply reflects addictive behaviour. The \nclaim that nicotine is more addictive than cocaine is a common one, but it is not valid. However, both \nare highly addicting drugs for which patterns of use and the development of dependence are strongly \ninfluenced by factors such as availability, price, social pressures, regulations and the characteristics \nof the drug itself (Henningfield, Cohen and Slade, 1991). Situational and social factors influence the \nbehaviour of smokers, young and old. Smokers who want to give up often state that they wish they had \nnever started; peer group influence in their teens had a strong impact on their decision to start smoking \nin the first place. Even mature adults find it difficult to stop smoking because they find themselves in \nsocial situations \u2013 at the backyard barbeques, coffee shops, restaurants, pubs and night clubs \u2013 that \nthey associate with smoking. The ban on smoking in public places, which made it more inconvenient \nto smoke, did not break this association with smoking and socialising. In fact, it gave smokers a reason \nto talk to fellow smokers, chat up members of the opposite sex, and complain about the restrictions on \npersonal freedom. \n\nUnderstanding consumer behaviour is crucial to the success of anti-smoking campaigns. The National \nTobacco Campaign in Australia aims to contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of adult daily smoking \nfrom 15.9 per cent to 10 per cent or less by 2018 (Australian Government, 2013). The campaign, which \nfeatures television, radio, print, outdoor and online advertising, focuses on the negative consequences of \nsmoking. As a result, smoking has lost some its \u2018coolness\u2019 and \u2018edginess\u2019. In Australia, the Tobacco Plain \nPackaging Act 2011 and the Tobacco Plain Packaging Regulations 2011 are part of the federal government\u2019s \nefforts to reduce smoking rates (Department of Health and Aging, 2012). The legislation prohibits the \nuse of logos, brand imagery and promotional text on tobacco products and packaging, and includes \nrestrictions on colour, size, format and materials of packaging, as well as the appearance of brand and \nvariant names. It is expected that the visceral images shown on the packaging and the use of fear appeals \nwill resonate with smokers. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.comlaw.gov.au\/Details\/C2011A00148\nhttp:\/\/www.comlaw.gov.au\/Details\/C2011A00148\nhttp:\/\/www.comlaw.gov.au\/Content\/FutureLaw\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n11 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nNumerous steps have been taken to reduce the marketing communications power of the cigarette industry. \nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) Framework Convention on tobacco control banned advertising \nand promotion of tobacco products in all media. Most countries have bans on the advertising of tobacco \nproducts on the internet, on social media and in virtual stores. However, the industry remains one step \nahead of the regulators. Researchers at the University of Sydney found that \u2018pro-smoking\u2019 smartphone \napps are readily available. They defined \u2018pro-smoking\u2019 apps as those that provided information about \nbrands of tobacco, where to buy tobacco products or images of tobacco brands or cigarettes. Some of \nthe apps are designed to mimic cigarette smoking (BinDihm, Freeman and Trevena, 2012). For instance \nusers can light up and smoke a virtual cigarette. Other apps depict a phone battery as a burning cigarette. \nIf a brand logo is visible in these apps, then the brand owner faces hefty fines for breaching the law. It \nmust be noted that Australian laws banning tobacco advertising on the internet only extend to those \nads that originate in Australia, in other words ads which are published by an Australian organisation \nor an Australian citizen. \n\nPromotion of smoking in new media is now emerging which traditionally has not been subjected to \nextensive monitoring by the government (Eagle et al., 2014). The anti-smoking lobby is concerned that \nthese apps are deliberately targeted at teenagers as they are fun, highly visible and easily accessible. On \nsmartphone app stores such as Apple and Android, hundreds of apps can be downloaded and delivered \ndirectly to mobile devices (Kellow, 2012). Furthermore, e-cigarettes, virtual images of cigarettes, ashtrays, \nembers and so on are likely to trigger cravings for tobacco. It is believed that the new frontier for tobacco \nadvertising will be through mobile media, cyber-games, virtual reality and apps (Eagle et al., 2014). \nMobile media represents a great opportunity to reach and engage young consumers. The government \nand the anti-smoking lobby need to understand what drives consumers to use certain branded mobile \napps if they want to reduce smoking rates. \n\n2.1 Consumer purchasing process\n\nFinding ways to influence the consumer decision making process is vital for both marketers and specialists \nin the area of integrated marketing communications (IMC). These steps are as follows (Quester, Pettigrew, \nKopanidis and Hill, 2014, p. 20):\n\n\u2022 Problem recognition\n\u2022 Information search\n\u2022 Evaluation of alternatives\n\u2022 Store choice and purchase \n\u2022 Post-purchase activities\n\nEach step of the decision-making process is important; however, two steps are directly related to \nintegrated marketing communications (IMC) campaigns: (1) information search, and (2) the evaluation \nof alternatives. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n12 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\n2.2 Problem recognition\n\nThe first step of the decision-making process occurs when the consumer notices a need or want. A gap \nexists between an individual\u2019s current state and desired state. The need or problem may be simple or \ncomplex and it can be influenced by numerous factors (Belch and Belch, 2012): \n\n\u2022 Out-of-stock or routine depletion, where consumers use up their existing supply of products \nand it must be replenished; \n\n\u2022 Dissatisfaction, where consumers become dissatisfied with the existing product or \nservice provider; \n\n\u2022 New needs, this may arise from changes in consumers\u2019 lives or a move to a new stage in the \nfamily life cycle. For instance, becoming a parent often results in demand for baby clothing, \nbaby furniture and so forth. In some cases, the purchase of a product leads to the purchase \nof related products or accessories (i.e., purchase of an iPad and iPad cover). Research and \ndevelopment and the introduction of new products and services to the marketplace can also \nstimulate consumers\u2019 desires to buy something novel.\n\n\u2022 Social norms and influence of other people, such as when a consumer visits a friend\u2019s \napartment and sees his or her new digital television and feels the desire to buy one as well.\n\nSuccessful entrepreneurs are adept at identifying unmet needs. Uber (https:\/\/www.uber.com) is an \nexample of an entrepreneurial venture that uses a smart phone app to connect drivers with riders. An \nindividual can request a car by using Uber\u2019s iPhone or Android app. Uber then sends the nearest driver \nto the customer\u2019s location to pick them up and Uber automatically charges the credit card for the taxi \nservice. However, local government has accused Uber of side-stepping laws in relation to taxi licences and \ncreating unfair competition for registered taxi-drivers (BBC News, 2014). The term \u2018mum entrepreneurs\u2019 \nis now in vogue and it refers to women who combine stay-at-home motherhood with business ventures; \nthey are good at identifying the needs of pregnant women and new parents. The global reach of the \ninternet means that targeting niche markets can be lucrative. For instance, organic baby skincare and \norganic cotton nappies are products aimed at a niche market. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttps:\/\/www.uber.com\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n13 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nNeeds, as outlined in Maslow\u2019s (1954, p. 236) theory of motivation, can be placed in a hierarchy ranging \nfrom basic to advanced. People will not focus on higher level needs until their basic needs have been \nfulfilled. Human needs may be physical in nature such as the need for food and water; people have a \nbasic need for security, such as the need to feel safe and free from harm. Needs may be psychological in \nnature, such as social needs (the need for friendship, love and a sense of belonging), the need for self-\nesteem (status, ego enhancement) and self-actualisation (self-fulfillment, realising one\u2019s full potential). \nClearly, people need to feel valued, to feel like they matter. Maslow\u2019s theory of motivation is very relevant \nto marketers. A motivation is a desired end state, and as consumers, we behave in certain ways in order to \nachieve some desired end state. In modern society, at the subsistence or survival level, needs are generally \nwell-met, and consumers do not need to focus on food, clean water, clothing and basic shelter. However, \na new mother may be motivated to buy organic baby food in order to care for her newborn infant. At the \nlevel of safety, the focus may move to home security products and house and contents insurance. At the \nlevel of belonging, the human need for social recognition and being part of a social group may give rise \nto marketing opportunities, such as online dating apps, chat-lines, clubs and societies. Fair trade brands \nare increasingly visible in supermarkets. According to the International Fair Trade Organisation, fair trade \nis an alternative approach to conventional trade based on a partnership between producers and traders, \nbusinesses and consumers. Fairtrade\u2019s vision is a world in which all producers can enjoy secure and \nsustainable livelihoods, fulfil their potential and decide on their future (Fair Trade International, 2015). \nFair Trade products appeal to our belonging needs since the purchase of the brand provides consumers \nwith a sense of belonging to a global, more equitable society. At the level of esteem, the focus may be \non cosmetics, fast cars, home improvements, furniture, fashion clothes, drinks, lifestyle products and \nservices. Self-actualization is generally understood in non-material terms, and it refers to being all that \none can be, realizing one\u2019s full potential; here the focus may be on products and services that promote \nself-improvement, including volunteer tourism, yoga retreats and tertiary education.\n\nA basic tenet of marketing is to meet the needs of customers, thus analyzing the needs of customers and \npositioning the brand as a solution to a customer problem is the key to success. Product attributes and \nbenefits need to be brought to the attention of consumers in this problem recognition stage. For example, \nthe Australian clothing brand Bonds (http:\/\/www.bonds.com.au\/) uses marketing communications which \nmay act as a catalyst for an individual to buy new underwear. Their website regularly has price specials \nand uses attractive models to display the various types of underwear that suits different body shapes. A \nneed can be triggered by a marketing communication. Advertising (along with other forms of marketing \ncommunication) helps consumers recognise when they have a problem and need to make a purchase \nthat can help alleviate the problem, such as using light-weight camping utensils when going trekking. \nThe dairy foods sector is adept at highlighting problems and positioned their products as \u2018solutions\u2019 to \nthese problems. According to the Fonterra, New Zealand\u2019s global co-operatively owned company, eating \nthree serves of calcium-rich dairy foods throughout life can help to maintain strong bones and may help \nto slow down the bone loss that occurs naturally with age (Fonterra, 2015). It must be noted that the \nmedical evidence linking calcium intake with the prevention of osteoporosis is weak (Hegsted, 1994).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.bonds.com.au\/\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n14 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nTimely reminders can be used to alert consumers to the need to purchase certain products, for instance \nvitamins to prevent the catching of winter colds. In some cases, consumers have inactive problems or \nneeds of which they are unaware. This can pose challenges for marketing communications. For instance, \nthe need for health insurance isn\u2019t really seen as a problem by young adults. \n\nIn some cases, marketers attempt to encourage consumers not to be content with their current situation \nand try to create new needs and wants. Some advertisements play on consumers\u2019 fears and insecurities, \nsuch as the need to apply anti-wrinkle cream or use a deodorant that won\u2019t lead to unsightly sweat marks. \nThis raises ethical issues and is one of the criticisms of marketing and its impact on society.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/elearningforkids\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n15 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nMarket research plays a key role in identifying consumer needs or problems associated with products. \nMarket research can take various forms. Ethnography is defined as \u201cthe study of people and cultures\u201d (Ang, \n2014, p. 42). In practice, ethnographic research involves participant observation research; the researcher \nbecomes immersed in the social milieu of the participants, observing how they live, work, shop and go \nabout their daily lives (Ang, 2014). The type of research is designed to provide descriptive information \nalong with the researcher\u2019s interpretations of what has been observed. Procter & Gamble developed the \nSwiffer home-cleaning solutions through ethnographic studies (Ohler, Samuel and McMurray, 2013), after \nobserving how consumers sweep and dust their homes. Traditionally the term ethnography referred to \nresearch by anthropologists who spent long periods of time living within a specific culture to learn more \nabout the people. Today ethnographic studies have become a diverse field and are used successfully as a \nform of consumer research. Other forms of research such as surveys, interviews and focus groups can help \nreveal how consumers feel about the brand or product. Market research and marketing intelligence often \nreveals pertinent information that leads to product redesign and the satisfaction of consumers\u2019 needs. \n\n2.3 Information search\n\nOnce a problem has been recognised, the consumer begins an internal search, mentally recalling products \nthat might satisfy the need. Often, the individual remembers how the need was met in the past. If a \nparticular brand was chosen and the experience was positive, the consumer repeats the purchase decision \nand the information search ends. When a previous purchase did not work out or if the consumer wishes \nto try something else, a more extensive internal search may result.\n\nInternal search\n\nDuring an internal search, the consumer thinks about all the alternatives that he or she is aware of and \nthis this is known as the \u201cawareness set\u201d (Quester et al., 2014, p. 95). Making sure an organisation\u2019s \nbrand becomes part of the consumer\u2019s evoked set, the set of potential purchase alternatives, is one \nobjective of integrated marketing communications, because it increases the chance that the brand will \nbe purchased. A product with a high level of brand awareness and brand equity will likely to be included \nin the consumer\u2019s evoked set. \n\nExternal search\n\nFollowing an internal search, the consumer makes a decision regarding an external search. When the \nconsumer has sufficient internal information, he or she moves to the next step of the decision-making \nprocess: evaluating the alternatives. A consumer who remains uncertain about the right brand to purchase \nundertakes an external search. External information can be gathered from a variety of sources, including \nfamily and friends, relatives, experts, books, magazines, newspapers, advertisements (and other forms \nof integrated marketing communications), in-store displays, salespeople and the Internet. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n16 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nWord-of-mouth (WOM) and viral maketing have a strong influence on consumer behaviour. Word-of-\nmouth refers to spoken communication as a means of transmitting information (Oxford Dictionary, \n2015). Viral marketing refers to ads that are \u201cpassed along from one person to another, spreading very \nquickly, almost like a disease\u201d (Ang, 2014, p. 135). Many marketers have come up with ways to induce \nconsumers to recommend their product or service to family and friends. Individuals are sometimes \noffered a financial incentive to spread the word, such as free merchandise or a discount if the message is \npassed along to friends who make a purchase. For example, Fitness First (http:\/\/refer.fitnessfirst.com.au) \nhas a \u2018refer a friend\u2019 promotion where a free guest pass can be emailed to a friend and the referrer gets \na reward. The file sharing service, dropbox, (http:\/\/www.dropbox.com) created awareness for their \nbusiness in a very short space of time and with a surprisingly low marketing budget. Viral marketing, \nwhere consumers were encouraged to pass along a message by email, helped this organisation gain \nnew consumers. \n\nFor most consumers, search begins at a search engine. Google has dominated the search market for many \nyears and it is the number one search engine in Australia, well ahead of Yahoo! and Bing. (Web Search, \n2015). It is used to find information on organisations, products, maps, news and entertainment \u2013 in \nfact, just about everything! Google pioneered \u2018universal search\u2019 which refers to the inclusion of search \nresults from multiple content sources such as videos, images, maps, books and websites. The search \nresults are almost instantaneous for the user. One key marketing communications goal is to make sure \nthat an organisation\u2019s name or brand is listed at the top of the search results. SEO, or search engine \noptimization, is the process of increasing the probability of a particular organisation\u2019s website emerging \nfrom a natural or organic search. It is also possible to pay for small text ads that appear at the top \nor side of a search result; these ads pop up when a particular word is typed in and they can increase \nbrand name awareness. Google\u2019s tool for placing and managing advertising is called Google AdWords \n(http:\/\/\/ww.google.com\/adwords). \n\nMarketing communications, which includes advertising, personal selling, direct marketing, interactive \nmarketing, sponsorship and public relations, all play a role in informing, educating and persuading the \nconsumer to buy a particular product or brand. E-mail plays an important role in IMC strategy. E-mail \nis a form of direct marketing and it uses an electronic channel to deliver a message. It has the advantage \nof measurability, marketers are able to analyse the number of responses (clicks) generated and the cost \nof each response. Email is cost effective but the consent or permission of the consumer must be sought \nbefore emails can be sent out.

Ability consists of a person\u2019s \neducational level combined with the specific knowledge the consumer has about a product and the brands \nin that product category. Educated individuals are more likely to spend time searching for information. \nThey are also more inclined to visit stores or search online prior to making decisions. There tends to \nbe an inverse relationship between knoweldge and search time. The knowledgeable consumer normally \nspends less time on the external search process because of the extensive knowledge he or she already \npossesses. In other words, the more you know, the less effort you put into searching for information. \n\nThe degree to which an external search takes place also depends on the consumer\u2019s level of motivation. \nThe greater the motivation, the more time spent on an external search. Motivation is determined by \nthree factors (Clow and Baack, 2010, p. 84): (1) level of involvement, (2) need for cognition and (3) level \nof shopping enthusiasm.\n\nInvolvement\n\nIndividuals experience greater motivation to search for information when involvement levels are high. \nInvolvement reflects the extent to which a stimulus or task is relevant to a consumer\u2019s existing needs, \nwants or values. Involvement, or degree of interest in a particular product, varies from person to person. \nThe level of involvement is influenced by factors such as the cost of the product, its importance and \nrisk attached to the purchase. The higher the price, the more time an individual will spend searching \nfor information. Product involvement depends on importance and risk. Choosing footwear might not \nbe an important decision to some young males but picking shoes for a job interview however may spur \ngreater involvement due to the social ramifications of dressing poorly at such an important event. There \nare different types of risk: performance risk refers to the risk of the product or service failing to perform \nas expected resulting in customer dissatisfaction (i.e, laser eye surgery not resulting in perfect vision), \nphysical risk refers to the risk of injury or damage (i.e., risk of infection from surgery, risk of injury \nfrom participating in adventure sports), social risk refers to the risk of looking bad in the eyes of one\u2019s \npeers (i.e., unfashionable clothing), financial risk refers to the risk of not making a wise investment or \nlosing money (i.e., paying too much for a house) and psychological risk refers to personal feelings of \nregret, fears or anxieties (i.e., \u201cI made the wrong decision\u201d). The role of marketers is to reduce risk for \nthe consumer. This can be achieved in various ways: stressing company reputation, offering guarantees, \nfree trials, customer testimonials and so forth.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n19 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nThere are many examples where previously low-involvement purchases suddenly become high-\ninvolvement purchases. For instance, the purchase of electricity for a household used to be routine or \nhabitual but it can suddenly become high involvement due to changes in the marketing environment. \nHouseholds that would like to switch to solar power and more sustainable forms of energy consumption \nhave to think more carefully about the decision. As another example, the online retailer, Farfetch \n(http:\/\/www.farfetch.com\/au\/unfollow) sells designer label sandals for hundreds of dollars, using the \ntagline \u201cUnfollow. For Fashion Lovers, Not Followers.\u201d This suggests that a low involvement product, \nsuch as flip-flops and flat sandals, is a high involvement purchase for some fashion-conscious women.\n\nThe study of consumer behaviour distinguishes between three forms of decision making: extensive, \nlimited and routine (Martin and Schouten, 2014, p. 81). These three forms of decision making are \nlinked to involvement. Extensive problem solving refers to an extensive search for information, learning \nand the careful evaluation of purchase alternatives. It is used to reduce the perceived risks associated \nwith high-involvement purchases. New, unfamiliar or very expensive \u2018once in a life-time\u2019 purchases \nare subject to extensive problem solving, such as overseas holidays, property, cars, an engagement ring \nor wedding dress. Limited problem solving involves the limited search for information and limited \nevaluation of alternatives. It tends to be linked with lower-risk purchases such as clothing or footwear \nand items that are bought on a regular basis. Routine purchasing involves habitual purchasing made \nwith little or no external search. It is linked with everyday purchases such as food and drink. To develop \neffective marketing communications, marketers need to have some understanding of the decision-making \nprocesses consumers employ.\n\nNeed for cognition and shopping orientation\n\nThe need for cognition is a personality characteristic that identifies individuals who engage in, and enjoy, \nmental activities. People with a high need for cognition tend to evaluate more information and make \nmore optimal in-store purchase decisions. The search also depends on a person\u2019s shopping orientation \n(Li, Kuo and Russell, 1999) or enthusiasm for shopping. Consumers who enjoy shopping undertake a \nmore in-depth search for products and services. To summarise, three key factors, involvement, need \nfor cognition and enthusiasm for shopping, combine to determine the individual\u2019s motivation to search \nfor additional information.\n\nTo summarise, from a marketing communications perspective, the search process represents an important \ntime to reach the consumer. The consumer\u2019s objective in making the effort to perform an external search \nis to acquire information leading to a better, more informed decision. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.farfetch.com\/au\/unfollow\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n20 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\n2.4 Evaluation of alternatives\n\nThe third step in the consumer buying decision-making process is the evaluation of alternatives. This stage \ninvolves the mental weighing of the potential costs and benefits associated with one or more products \nbeing considered for purchase. Attributes such as a product or brand\u2019s price, style, prestige, brand name, \nperformance are examples of attributes that demand consideration by the consumer. Consumers differ \nregarding the importance they place on each attribute. \n\nThree models portray the nature of the evaluation process: (1) the evoked set approach, (2) the \nmultiattribute approach and (3) affect-referral (Clow and Baack, 2010, p. 90). Understanding how \nconsumers evaluate choices helps the firm\u2019s specialised communications agencies develop materials that \nlead consumers to favour a given brand.\n\nThe evoked set method\n\nNarayan and Markin (1975) made a major contribution to the literature when they developed a model \nof the evoked set formation process. They identified the awareness set and its subsets. The evoked set \nconsists of the brands the individual considers in a purchasing situation. In addition to the evoked \nset, two other sets of brands become part of the evaluation of alternatives stage: the \u2018inept set\u2019 and the \n\u2018inert set\u2019. The inept set consists of the brands that are not acceptable; they are not considered because \nthey elicit negative feelings. These negative sentiments are normally caused by a bad customer service \nexperience or a bad experience with a particular brand. They can also stem from negative word of \nmouth (i.e, disparaging comments made by a friend) or from a negative reaction to an advertisement \n(and other elements of marketing communications). The inert set holds the brands that the consumer \nis aware of but to which the consumer has neutral feelings. In other words, the consumer is indifferent \nto these brands. Furthermore, the consumer lacks knowledge about these brands and usually eliminates \nthem as alternatives. In most purchase situations, the only brands considered are those in the evoked set. \n\nOne goal of marketing communications is to move the brand from a consumer\u2019s inert set to the evoked \nset. Placing a brand name in the evoked sets of consumers is often the primary goal of marketing \ncommunications. The consumer should see the brand name frequently in as many locations as possible. \nThe brand and its key benefits should be embedded into the consumer\u2019s long-term memory. When a \nconsumer evaluates alternatives, and if the organisation\u2019s brand becomes part of the set being considered, \nthen the advertisement (and other elements of marketing communications) has been successful. \n\nThe multiattribute approach\n\nAnother model the explains how consumers evaluate purchasing alternatives is the multiattribute \napproach. It is most useful for understanding high-involvement types of purchases. The multiattribute \nmodel (Wilkie and Pessemier, 1983) suggests that a consumer\u2019s attitude towards a brand is determined by \n\n\u2022 The brand\u2019s performance on the product or brand attributes\n\u2022 The importance of each attribute to the consumer\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n21 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nThe higher a brand rates on attributes that are important to the consumer, the more likely it will be \npurchased. For instance, a consumer interested in sustainability might choose one brand over another \ndepending on attributes such as:\n\n\u2022 Natural ingredients\n\u2022 Organic certification\n\u2022 Renewable or recycled materials used for packaging\n\u2022 Fair trade policies\n\nHence, a \u2018green\u2019 or ethical consumer could end up buying an eco-friendly household cleaner, and more \nspecifically, a brand like Seventh Generation, after using the multi-attribute approach.\n\nProviding consumers with information about a brand\u2019s performance on criteria that are likely to be used \nis the key to success in IMC campaigns. This can be achieved on a brand\u2019s website, in brochures and \nprint ads, where consumers often gather information in relation to high-involvement decisions. Retailers \nand the sales force also play a role in the provision of information; getting information to consumers \njust as they need that information presents the greatest challenge to the marketer but also the greatest \nopportunity for a sale.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nwww.discovermitas.com\n\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/mitas\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n22 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nTechnology-based products are often designed with multiple features and benefits; for instance an \nadvertisement for a camera may highlight features such as screen size, weight, storage, shutter speed and \nmegapixels, as well as price, style and customer service. It must be noted that consumers shouldn\u2019t be \noverloaded with information. Information overload means the too much information seriously impairs \nor inhibits consumer decision making abilities (Herbig and Kramer, 1994). Consumers, faced with too \nlittle time and too much stress, become unhappy with the complexity of everyday products in their lives. \nMarketers should promote a few design principles so the product won\u2019t intimidate potential customers, \nand the simplicity and usability of the product should be stressed in promotion. Stressing a limited number \nof benefits means that products become comprehensible, manageable and likely to succeed (Herbig and \nKramer, 1994). Over time, consumers can obtain additional information to evaluate the product. For \nexample, BMW tends to emphasise design and performance, as witnessed by the tag line \u2018the ultimate \ndriving machine\u2019, which was since been replaced with \u2018sheer driving pleasure\u2019 (http:\/\/www.bmw.com). The \nconsumer can learn about other features, such as fuel efficiency, safety, CO2 emissions and accessories \n(i.e, sunblinds and adapters for Apple iPhone) at a later stage by exploring the website.\n\nAffect referral\n\nA third model of consumer evaluations of purchase alternatives, affect referral, suggests that consumers \nchoose the brands they like the best, or the ones with which they have emotional connections. In many \nsitations, consumers do not carefully evaluate brands or think a lot about product attributes. Instead, \nthey simply buy the brand that incites positive feelings (Clow and Baack, 2010, p. 92). Confectionary, \nbreakfast cereals, cola and coffee are some of the products that consumers select in this way. These \npurchases tend to have low levels of involvement. They also tend to be frequently purchased products. \nThe affect referral model also explains the purchase of high priced and \u2018socially-conspicious\u2019 brands. As \nan example, GoldCoast Skateboards (http:\/\/skategoldcoast.com\/) is based in California and specializes \nin longboards, cruisers and skateboards. Design is critical to the brand\u2019s success. The craftsmanship, \ncolour and aesthetic appeal of the product makes it stand out from competing brands. For some \nconsumers, GoldCoast represents the best brand of skateboards and will be purchased using the affect \nreferral approach. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.bmw.com\nhttp:\/\/skategoldcoast.com\/\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n23 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nThe affect referral model explains three things (Clow and Baack, 2010, p. 92) which are: mental energy, \nprior purchase decisions and emotional bonding. First, this approach to product evaluation saves mental \nenergy. Some purchases do not deserve much effort and consumers want make a choice quickly rather than \nanalysing every alternative. Second, a multiattribute model approach might have been used previously \nwhen making a purchase. The person has already spent a great deal of time considering various product \nattributes, deciding which are most critical, and reaching a decision. Going through the process again \nwould be \u2018reinventing the wheel\u2019. Third, consumers often develop emotional bonds with brands. In terms \nof the purchase decision, an emotional bond with a product can be the strongest and most salient factor \nin the decision (Schneider, 2004). In some cases, the connection between the consumer and the brand \ncan be so strong that brand communities emerge (Stratton and Northcoat, 2014). Successful brands like \nHarley Davidson, Apple and Lego have established emotional bonds with consumers. A bond generates \nbrand loyalty and enhances brand equity. Consequently, consumers do not evaluate alternatives because \nof the strong bond with the brand. \n\n2.5 Store choice and purchase\n\nThe store choice and purchase process involves all the decisions necessary to complete a transaction, such \nas deciding what to buy and where to buy the product or brand. In some cases, it may involve arranging \nfinance, deciding on the method of payment and the method of delivery.\n\nMost consumer products are acquired through some form of retail outlet, be that a department store \nlike David Jones or a supermarket like Coles and Woolworths. The retailing sector is very diverse and it \nincludes grocery retailers, book retailing, furniture retailing, petrol retailing, hardware and DIY, clothing, \nfootwear and consumer electronics. Retailing is an important sector in the services-based economy and \na major employer. Retailers purchase products from manufacturers for the purpose of re-selling them \nto final consumers and as such, they are an important link between producers and consumers. Retailers \noften sell their own brands, known as store brands; these brands are generally brands of a reasonable \nquality that appeal to the cost-conscious consumer. Store brands give the retailer more power in the \nchannel and the manufacturer\u2019s brands compete with them for shelf space. Woolworths has a range of \nbrands to suit the needs of different target markets, including Woolworths Home Brands aimed at the \ncost-conscious consumer, Woolworths Select aimed at the quality conscious consumer and Woolworths \nFree From (gluten-free range) aimed at the individual with special dietary needs (Woolworths, 2015).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n24 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nOnline retailing is a very dynamic area of marketing. Bricks-and-mortar or physical stores are a real \nasset to retailers as they allow consumers to have a hands-on experience of goods; however, there has \nbeen a substantial cultural change in how people are shopping. For example footwear is now bought \nonline. soleRebels (http:\/\/www.solerebelsfootwear.co), is a Fair Trade certified footwear company that \nsells colourful, eco-friendly sandals that are made from recycled materials such truck tyres, along with \nnatural fibers such as jute, koba and organic cotton. The eco-sensitive products are sold around the \nworld through the website. As familiarity with, and confidence in, online shopping grows, retailers have \nto move online and capitalise on the trend towards multi-channel shopping. More and more retailers \ncomplement the traditional retail experience in-store by adding digital technologies such as QR codes that \nenable a shopper to access further details about a product if required (Vaswani, 2012). In Australia, online \nsales accounted for 6 per cent of total retail spending in in 2010, which equates to $12.6 billion. Online \npenetration of retail sales in Australia is high in categories such as books, CDs, DVDs, clothing, sporting \ngoods, electrical and electronic goods, cosmetics and toys, but much lower for groceries (Productivity \nCommission, 2011). Many consumers first conduct online research before making a purchase in retail \nstores. The number of women shopping online is now greater than the number of Australian males \nshopping online (Nielsen, 2012).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\nMASTER IN  MANAGEMENT\n\nmim.admissions@ie.edu Follow us on IE MIM Experiencewww.ie.edu\/master-management\n\n#10 WORLDWIDE\nMASTER IN MANAGEMENT \n\nFINANCIAL TIMES\n\n55 Nationalities\nin class\n\n5 Specializations\nPersonalize your program \n\nLength: 1O MONTHS\nAv.

For instance, parents who need new toys \nfor their children, and who are familiar with Kmart, may decide to visit that store and select one of the \nbrands there. Store image refers to the target market\u2019s perception of all the attributes associated with a \nstore or retail outlet. For example, components such as quality, selection, style (e.g. fashionable or not) \nand price help shape store image. German discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl tend to target lower \nsocio-economic groups, along with students and price-sensitive families. Other factors such as the size \nof the store and its location can draw shoppers to the store. IKEA, along with many other retailers, pays \nclose attention to store location. IKEA tends to locate its stores in outer-city locations, areas that have \ngood transport links and that are close to large urban populations. \n\nIn-store decision-making is an important topic to retailers and product manufacturers seeking to \nincrease sales. For the manufacturer, key decisions are as follows: shelf space position, brand-image \nadvertising; whether to adopt an exclusive or intensive distribution strategy; strategies for the use of \nsales promotion and point-of-purchase displays; whether to invest in training programs for retail sales \nstaff and co-operative advertising. Co-operative advertising is an agreement where retailers share the \ncost of such advertising with manufacturers (Quester, Pettigrew, Kopanidis and Hill, 2014). One study \nfound that consumers were more likely to make an in-store decision when the product was displayed \nat the end of the aisle or at the checkout register than if it was displayed in-aisle. Deal prone consumers \nmade more in-store decisions. Consumers with a higher level of purchase involvement were less prone \nto making in-store decisions (Inman and Winer, 1988). A host of factors affect consumer behaviour, such \nas whether the consumer is shopping along or with others, point-of-purchase displays, price reductions, \nstore layout, stock-outs, sales personnel and queues. It is not unusual for people to get frustrated with \nlong queues and leave the store without making a purchase. Apple has invested in company-owned retail \nstores around the world. It is an example of an organisation that seeks to influence consumers though \nproduct displays, store design and high quality customer service. Some staff members are employed \nas product specialists, are highly trained and expected to give customers an answer to just about any \ntechnical question. \n\nStore design and store atmospherics is the key to forging important connection with customers and leaving \nwith them a lasting memory of their experience. It\u2019s something women have known for generations: \nthere\u2019s more to shopping than coming home with bags of stuff. Retailers and retail developers know \nthat giving the consumer a memorable experience and appealing to the five senses will lead consumers \nto stay longer, shop more, and leave with pleasant memories. Fashion retailers know they have to have \nsome music playing and turn the lights on so that consumers will linger and be able to see how the \nclothes look when they try them on. Most supermarkets have in-store bakeries and the attractive array \nof baked goods and smell of freshly-baked bread can entice consumers to buy more. It is not uncommon \nfor shoppers to enter a supermarket or retail store with the intention of purchasing a particular brand \nand leave with a different brand or additional items. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n26 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\n2.6 Post-purchase behavior\n\nThis stage covers post-purchase dissonance, product use, product disposal, along with concepts of \ncustomer satisfaction, repeat purchasing behavior and customer loyalty. The term \u2018dissonance\u2019 refers \nto regret, doubt or anxiety about the correctness of one\u2019s decision after a purchase has been made. It is \noften associated with high-involvement purchases and extended decision making, such as the decision \nto buy a car or a house. The probability of post-purchase dissonance, and the magnitude of dissonance, \nis a function of four factors (Quester, Pettigrew, Kopanidis and Hill, 2014):\n\n\u2022 The degree of commitment and\/or whether the decision can be revoked\n\u2022 The importance of the decision to the consumer\n\u2022 The difficulty of choosing among the alternatives\n\u2022 The individual\u2019s tendency to experience anxiety\n\nFor the marketer, a key question is how can dissonance be reduced? How can marketers help consumers? \nVery often, marketers will seek to reassure the customer that they made the right purchase decision. \nThey do this though marketing communications, such as by running advertisements that show people \nwho are satisfied with their purchases; follow-up sales call and follow-up customer satisfaction surveys.\n\nProduct usage behaviours are all the behaviours associated with a consumer\u2019s use of a product after \nit is purchased, but before it is used up or discarded. Marketers are interested in how consumers use \na particular product since it may be used in innovative ways or may have multiple uses. For instance, \nbaking soda is used as a baking ingredient, a cleaning agent and as an ingredient in toothpaste. Today, \nconsumers are becoming more environmentally conscious and sustainable usage behaviour could include \ncareful usage of a product, such as not wasting food or regularly servicing a car. Disposition behaviors \n(also known as disposal behaviours) are all the behaviours associated with a product once a consumer \nno longer uses it. For many consumers, this could involve recycling and thinking twice before throwing \nsomething into landfill. Marketers are increasingly getting involved in product disposal, such as Apple \nwith its recycling programme for computers. Apple also encourages consumers to bring their old iPods \nor mobile phones to an Apple Retail Store and receive a 10% discount on the purchase of a new iPod \n(Apple, 2015).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n27 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nAchieving customer satisfaction is a key goal in marketing. Satisfied customers should be pleased with the \nperformance or physical functioning of the product and gain satisfaction from other attributes such as \ndesign, packaging, brand image and after-sales service. In many cases, there is an affective or emotional \nresponse associated with owing and using a product. If the customer is satisfied, then brand loyalty \noften emerges. Brand loyalty, however, is different from simple repeat purchasing behaviour; it implies a \npsychological commitment to the brand and not simply routine or frequent purchasing. Evaluation of a \nproduct or a service is influenced by the customer\u2019s expectations \u2013 what they expected prior to entering \ninto an exchange \u2013 and perceived performance of the product or service \u2013 how the product performs \nin the eyes of the customer. In some cases, organisations \u2018over-promise\u2019 and customers end up being \ndisappointed with the product or service. If customer dissatisfaction occurs, there are several possible \noutcomes (Quester, Pettigrew, Kopanidis and Hill, 2014):\n\n\u2022 The consumer takes no action\n\u2022 The consumer switches brands, products or stores\n\u2022 The consumer warns friends, family and colleagues and engages in negative word-of-mouth\n\u2022 The consumer takes direct action by complaining to the company, to a consumer rights \n\norganisation, to the government and by posting comments to online complaint sites. In some \ncases, retailers actually encourage customers to post reviews of their products and services (i.e., \ntripadvisor.com; epinion.com). In some cases, the consumer takes legal action.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\ntripadvisor.com\nepinion.com\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/EOT\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n28 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nTo avoid these negative outcomes, marketers need to satisfy consumers by:\n\n\u2022 being honest and creating reasonable expectations through marketing communications \n\u2022 maintaining consistent quality so that the customer\u2019s expectations are fulfilled\n\u2022 having a complaints policy and dealing with complaints promptly \n\u2022 offering money-back guarantees \n\nCustomer service is critical to the success of organisations. More and more organisations are establishing \na \u2018Customer Charter\u2019 where they make explicit promises in areas such as delivery time, quality and \nsafety; if promises are not met, then money-back guarantees are offered. Research shows that speed and \npersonal contact are important in retaining the customer after there has been a breakdown in service \n(Weiser, 1995).\n\n2.7 Consumer attitudes\n\nA great deal of advertising attempts to create favourable attitudes, reinforce current positive attitudes or \nchange negative attitudes. For instance, fast food companies struggle to get people to see their menu items \nas being fresh, healthy and nutritious and overcoming negative towards fast food is very difficult. Fast \nfood tends to be associated with high levels of obesity. Positive attitudes are often featured in marketing \ncommunications campaigns. Most people consider recorded voices in customer service calls or being \n\u2018put on hold\u2019 to be a nuisance. An advertising creative can tap into that attitude and use it to present \na service in a more favourable light. By stressing contact with \u2018real people\u2019 and fast response times, a \nnegative attitude can be turned into a more positive experience.\n\nAn attitude is a mental position taken towards a topic, a person or an event that influences the holder\u2019s \nfeelings, perceptions, learning processes and subsequent behaviour (Fishbein and Ajzen, 1975). Attitudes \ncan drive purchase decisions. A consumer holding a positive attitude towards a brand is more likely to \nbuy it. Someone who enjoys an advertisement, and other elements of marketing communications, will \nbe more likely to purchase the product. However, the theory of planned behaviour (Ajzen, 1991) shows \nthat there is generally a gap between attitudes and behaviour. For instance, research shows that many \nconsumers have positive attitudes towards locally-grown, organic food and are concerned about food \nmiles, but barriers to purchase exist, such as the premium price, lack of availability, seasonality, lack of \nvariety and the inconvenience associated with buying the food at farmers\u2019 markets and organic stores. \nIn other words, there are high levels of interest in locally-grown organic food, and this interest seems to \nbe spreading across groups and countries, but it is a long road between concern and action.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n29 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nAttitudes consist of three components: (1) affective (feelings), (2) cognitive (beliefs), and (3) behaviourial \n(response tendencies). This model is referred to as the tri-component attitude model (Quester, Pettigrew, \nKopanidis and Hill, 2014, p. 337). The affective component consists of the feelings or emotions a person \nhas about the object. The cognitive component refers to a person\u2019s mental images, understanding and \ninterpretations of the object or issue. The behaviourial component contains an individual\u2019s intentions, \nactions or behaviour. \n\nAttitudes develop in various ways (see Figure 2). \n\n \n\nCognitive   Affective  Behavioural    \n\n \n\nAffective   Behavioural   Cognitive  \n\n \n\nBehavioural    Cognitive   Affective \n\n\t\r \u00a0\nFigure 2: Development of Attitudes: Alternative Models \nSource: Author-derived\n\nOne common sequence of events that takes place in attitude formation is: Cognitive \u2192 Affective \u2192 \nBehavioural (Clow and Baack, 2010). Most of the time, a person first develops an understanding of an \nidea or an object. In the case of marketing, this understanding revolves around the features and benefits \nof the product or service. These thoughts, understandings or beliefs emerge from exposure to marketing \ncommunications or to word-of-mouth advertising. For instance, a consumer seeing the Australasian \nNew Car Assessment Program (Ancap) website or advertisement (http:\/\/www.ancap.com.au\/) might \ndevelop the impression that Ancap is a reputable organisation that has concern for peoples\u2019 safety as its \nnumber one priority. \n\nThe affective part of the attitude refers to the general feelings or emotions a person attaches to something. \nProducts and services can generate an emotional reaction. For instance, negative emotions are often \nassociated with cigarettes and smoking. The marketing communications shown in the following \ngovernment website: http:\/\/health.gov.au\/internet\/main\/publishing.nsf\/Content\/tobacco-warn-cigar \nattempts to influence emotions. In many cases, emotions are not aroused. When considering items such \nas tissue paper or cough medicine, emotions or attitudes about them will be relatively benign. \n\nDecisions and action tendencies are the behavioural parts of attitudes. For instance, if a person feels \nstrongly enough about skin cancer, he or she will avoid sun-bathing and will wear sunscreen. Most \nattitudes are not held that strongly. Some people might feel favourably about a topic, such as green \nmarketing, but this does not necessarily change their purchasing behaviour.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ancap.com.au\/\nhttp:\/\/health.gov.au\/internet\/main\/publishing.nsf\/Content\/tobacco-warn-cigar\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n30 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nAttitudes develop in other ways. An alternative process is: Affective \u2192 Behavioural \u2192 Cognitive \n(Clow and Baack, 2010). Marketing communications can first appeal to the emotions or feelings held \nby consumers in order to move them to \u2018like\u2019 a product and purchase it (the behaviourial omponent). \nCognitive understanding of the product comes after the purchase. For example, a consumer visits the \nwebsite, or see the ad for Uniworld Cruises, (http:\/\/uniworldcruises.com.au), is drawn to the idea of \nbeing \u2018pampered\u2019 in a luxury boutique cruise line. Emotionally, he or she has a desire to book a river \ncruise and takes action. Cognitive reasoning about booking a cruise follows the emotional experience.\n\nSome attitudes result from a third combination of the components, as follows: Behavioural \u2192 Cognitive \n\u2192 Affective (Clow and Baack, 2010). Purchases that require little thought, that have a low price, or do \nnot demand any emotional investment might follow this path. For instance, while walking through a \nsupermarket, a consumer may notice a new brand of biscuits on sale. The person may have never seen \nthe brand before, but, because it is attractively packaged, decides to put it into the shopping basket. \nThe consumer goes home, eats the biscuits and discovers a liking for its taste and texture. Finally, the \nconsumer reads the package to learn more about contents, including how many calories it contained. \nHe or she finally develops feelings towards the product that might affect future purchases.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\n\u201cThe perfect start \nof a successful, \ninternational career.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE \nto discover why both socially \n\nand academically the University \n\nof Groningen is one of the best \n\nplaces for a student to be www.rug.nl\/feb\/education\n\nExcellent Economics and Business programmes at:\n\nhttp:\/\/uniworldcruises.com.au\nhttp:\/\/www.rug.nl\/feb\/bookboon?utm_source=AdBookboon&utm_medium=Bookboon&utm_campaign=130215Bookboon\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n31 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nNo matter which path is taken to develop attitudes, each component will be present, to some extent. Some \nattitudes are relatively trivial (e.g. \u2018I like sailing, even though I hardly ever get time to sail\u2019). Others are \nstaunchly held, such as \u2018I hate cigarette smoke!\u2019 Both are associated with feelings towards things, including \nproducts in the marketplace that may eventually result in purchases. Atttiudes that are strongly held can \nbe difficult to change. The \u2018elaboration likelihood model\u2019 (Petty and Cacioppo, 1986; Petty, Cacioppo and \nShuman, 1993) is a model of how attitudes are formed and how they can be changed under different \nlevels of involvement. High involvement results in a \u2018central route\u2019 to attitude change, where consumers \nthink carefully about the message and logical appeals can help change attitudes. Low involvement results \nin the \u2018peripheral route\u2019 to attitude change, whereby consumers are not interested in reading a lot of \ninformation and hence emotional appeals (i.e., humour, celebrity endorsement) and hedonic appeals \n(i.e., linking product consumption with pleasurable experiences) tend to be more effective.\n\n2.8 Consumer values\n\nAttitudes reflect an individual\u2019s personal values. Values are strongly held beliefs about what is desirable. \nValues frame attitudes and lead to the judgments that guide personal actions. Values tend to endure. \nThey normally form during childhood, although they can change as a person matures and experiences \nlife. Factors that affect a person\u2019s values include the individual\u2019s personality, the family, work environment \nand culture. By appealing to basic values, marketers try to convince prospective consumers that the \norganisation\u2019s products align with their values (Clow and Baack, 2010, p. 87). \n\nThe World Wildlife Fund (http:\/\/www.wwf.org.au) and Greenpeace (http:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/ \naustralia\/en) are not-for-profit organisations that use visually arresting imagery to highlight animal \nwelfare issues, various environmental issues and the consequences of global warming. Individuals who \npossess strong environmental values tend to pay attention to green advertisements. These types of \nadvertisements are available for viewing on the \u2018Ads of the World\u2019 website (http:\/\/adsoftheworld.com) \nwhich is a large archive of creative adverts from around the world.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.wwf.org.au\nhttp:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/australia\/en\nhttp:\/\/www.greenpeace.org\/australia\/en\nhttp:\/\/adsoftheworld.com\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n32 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nIn terms of consumer decision-making processes, both attitudes and values are influential. A product or \nservice tied to a relatively universal value, such as patriotism, helps an organisation present a product or \nservice in a positive image. Coles (http:\/\/www.coles.com.au\/) attempted to do this with its \u2018We Support \nAussie Growers\u2019 communications campaign which was replete with Australian imagery. The campaign \nwas based on research by Coles that found that Australian consumers are among \u201cthe most passionate \nin the world when it comes to supporting local producers, with almost 70 per cent placing a high or \nvery high level of importance on choosing products made in their own country\u201d (Coles, 2012). The goal \nwas to transfer positive feelings of patriotism to Coles\u2019 service. However, this trust in Australian- grown \nproduce was undermined after a current affairs program, Four Corners, revealed serious abuses of labour \nin the fresh produce sector. Their investigation revealed the food being picked, packed and processed by \nexploited labour was sold to consumers nationwide. Farmers tend to employ a labour-hire contractor who \nsources the workers on behalf of the farmers. This practice leaves the workers vulnerable to exploitation. \nThere was evidence of labour-hire contractors taking large cuts from their workers\u2019 wages, which left \nthe migrant workers getting paid well below the legal minimum wage. The National Farmers Federation \nresponded by stating that mistreatment of workers had no place on Australian farms (Meldrom-Hanna, \nRussell and Christodoulo, 2015). It remains to be seen whether consumer attitudes towards Australian \ngrown produce will shift from positive to negative. Woolworths, the Australian supermarket chain, \nattempted to appeal to universal values such as patriotism in a recent campaign on Anzac Day. Anzac \nDay is observed on 25 April each year. Anzac Day is named after the Australian and New Zealand \nArmy Corps, which landed at Gallipoli in Turkey during World War I on 25 April 1915. Anzac Day is \na solemn day where Australians remember the sacrifice of all Australians who served and died in wars, \nconflicts and peacekeeping operations (Commonwealth of Australia, 2014). An online campaign led \nby Woolworths caused outrage among customers, who accused the supermarket giant of exploiting the \nAnzac Day centenary. In its commemoration website, Woolworths featured its logo and the line \u201cfresh \nin our memories\u201d which echoed its brand slogan \u201cWoolworths \u2013 The Fresh Food People (http:\/\/www.\nwoolworths.com.au). The grocery giant was forced to apologise and delete its Anzac commemoration \nwebsite (In Daily, 2015).\n\n2.9 Ethics box: marketers turn to advergames to appeal to children\n\nChildren are a significant consumer group and their purchasing power is growing. They also play a \nkey role in family buying behaviour, and through pester power they can persuade their parents to buy \neverything from breakfast cereals to toys to household goods.

Advergames are games that are hosted on company websites and they are developed \nexclusively to promote brands. While product placement in movies and videos is not a new marketing \ntactic, \u2018\u2018advergames\u2019\u2019 turn the concept of \u2018\u2018product placement\u2019\u2019 into \u2018\u2018product entertainment\u2019\u2019. Advergames \nengage consumers for extended periods of time, typically 10\u201315 minutes, which, when compared with \na traditionally broadcast 30-second commercial, is a very high level of interaction (Chapman, Kelly, \nBochynska and Kornman, 2008). The main aim of advergames is to increase brand name awareness \nand establish brand preference, but they can also be used to collect data about consumers. Advergaming \nis available on the majority of websites targeting children. One advergame for Kellogg\u2019s Froot Loops \nrequires children to find Froot Loops cereal pieces before the monster gets them (http:\/\/www.frootloops.\ncom\/gamesitemap.html). Most advergames are simple but entertaining. The majority of advergames \nincorporate brand logos, sound and have features to extend game play such as prompting children to \nplay again. It is assumed that children are highly susceptible to persuasion via advergames, but empirical \nevidence is scarce. A recent study concluded that brand prominence in advergames led to increased brand \nrecall and recognition, whereas game involvement led to more positive brand attitudes. Most children \nwere unaware of the persuasive intent of the advergame, i.e., that they are being targeted as consumers \n(van Reijmersdal, Rozendaal and Buijzen, 2012).\n\nGiven the concern with obesity rates, academics in the public health area are increasingly concerned \nabout the marketing of energy-dense foods to children and adolescents, such as high-sugar drinks, ice \ncream, chocolate, confectionery (Freeman and Chapman, 2008). There are ethical issues associated with \nmarketing to children. The American Psychological Association (APA) noted that children, especially \nunder the age of eight, normally lack the ability to recognize advertising as biased or untrue, and \nconsequently view them as true (Mallinckrodt and Mizerski, 2007).\n\nMarketers use other techniques to attract children to the brand, such as the use of a brand mascot, \ncartoon characters or professional sports players. For example Freddo is a popular brand of chocolate \nwith children (see https:\/\/www.cadbury.com.au\/Products\/Pre-teens-Confectionery\/Freddo.aspx).\n\nCadbury spent millions of dollars creating a new Internet cartoon series featuring Freddo the Frog. \nThe marketing features puzzles, games and activities embedded within the cartoon where children can \nbe involved in the cartoon\u2019s development. Cadbury claims this represents responsible marketing, as no \nchocolate is featured (Jollo, 2011). Birds Eye is a well-known brand in the frozen food industry, owned \nby Simplot, Australia. Its television advertising features the Birds Eye Birds, and according to the website, \nthey \u201chelp prepare a variety of delicious meals in these fun commercials\u201d (http:\/\/birdseye.com.au\/Meet-\nthe-birds). Company websites usually contain at least one downloadable item such as screen wallpaper, \nscreensavers, desktop items and colouring pages. Websites often contain features to allow individuals to \ncustomise the site. These include features to create a personal account, participate in a website community \nor be involved in online shopping (Weber, Story and Harnack, 2006).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.frootloops.com\/gamesitemap.html\nhttp:\/\/www.frootloops.com\/gamesitemap.html\nhttps:\/\/www.cadbury.com.au\/Products\/Pre-teens-Confectionery\/Freddo.aspx\nhttp:\/\/birdseye.com.au\/Meet-the-birds\nhttp:\/\/birdseye.com.au\/Meet-the-birds\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n34 \n\nCase Study: virtual smoking and apps \u2013 the new \nfrontier of cigarette marketing communications?\n\nMany European countries have strict regulations on advertising to children. Sweden has a long-standing \nban on all television advertising aimed at children under 12, including toys, sweets and drinks (Jolly, \n2011). In Australian, there are no statutory regulations on the marketing of products and services to \nchildren. At present, most websites have features designed to protect children from inappropriate material. \nThese include privacy codes, marketing codes, statements about the need to be over the age 12 of enter \nthe site and the requirement of parental consent to enter the website. Online marketing is subject to the \nvoluntary Advertising and Marketing Communications to Children and the Food and Beverages Advertising \nand Marketing Communications Code developed by the Australian Association of National Advertisers \n(AANA, 2012). However this code does not cover advergames, and this is a loophole that can be exploited \nby marketers. Internationally, previous attempts to regulate Internet content have failed, primarily due \nto its constantly changing structure, whereby regulations are quickly made redundant, and its global \nnature, so that those wishing to avoid regulations can simply move their site off-shore.\n\nQuestions\n\n1.

In other words, it refers to how people make sense of their \nworld and perceptions will vary from one person to the next. From a marketing point of view, three \nprocesses deserve attention:\n\n1. Selective attention is the tendency for people to screen out most of the information to which \nthey are exposed. Consumers are exposed to hundreds of marketing messages daily. Many are \nignored. Marketers go to great lengths to get their advertisements, or other forms or marketing \ncommunication, noticed and there are various ways of overcoming this attention barrier. \nSpecialists in the area of marketing communications will use a variety of tactics, such as loud \nmusic, sound, large text and visually arresting images, to capture the attention of the consumer \nand break through the clutter.\n\n2. Selective distortion refers to the tendency of people to interpret information in a way that will \nsupport what they already believe or value. Thus marketers know that communication is rife \nwith problems and the intended message can be misunderstood; therefore, it is important to \npre-test and post-test advertisements (and other elements of marketing communications).\n\n3. Selective retention means that people will remember some information and forget other \npieces of information. In general, people will retain information that supports their attitudes \nand beliefs. Thus repetition may be important to ensure that the message is retained by the \ntarget market.\n\n3.1 Cognition\n\nKnowing how people store, retrieve and evaluate information assists marketers and communications \nagencies to develop better advertisements (and other elements of marketing communications). The first \nstep is to understand cognition \u2013 how various thought processes and memories work (Clow and Baack, \n2010, p. 88). \n\nCognitive maps are simulations of the knowledge structures and memories embedded in an individual\u2019s \nbrain (Kearney and Kaplan, 1997; Kaplan and Kaplan, 1989). These structures contain a person\u2019s \nassumptions, beliefs, interpretation of facts, feelings and attitudes about the larger world. These thought \nprocesses interpret new information and determine a response to fresh information or a novel situation. \nFigure 1 shows a cognitive map for a consumer of Sizzler, an Australian chain of restaurants. The website \nemphasises \u2018variety and freedom to choose\u2019 (http:\/\/www.sizzler.com.au) and it is these features that \ndifferentiate Sizzler from other restaurants; consumers are free to help themselves to whatever they wish \nas regards the soup, salad, pasta, fruit and dessert bars.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.sizzler.com.au\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n36 \n\nPerception\n\n \n\n   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n         \n\n \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n       \n\n \n\n\t\r \u00a0\n\nHamburger\t\r \u00a0 Restaurants\t\r \u00a0\nDine-\u00ad\u2010In\t\r \u00a0\n\nGreat\t\r \u00a0Food\t\r \u00a0\t\r \u00a0\n\nFast\t\r \u00a0Foods\t\r \u00a0\n\nSizzler\t\r \u00a0\nLa\t\r \u00a0Porchetta\t\r \u00a0\n\nDominos\t\r \u00a0\nPizza\t\r \u00a0 Pizza\t\r \u00a0 Excellent\t\r \u00a0\n\nService\t\r \u00a0\n\nPizza\t\r \u00a0Hut\t\r \u00a0 Quick\t\r \u00a0 Red\t\r \u00a0Rooster\t\r \u00a0\n\n\t\r \u00a0\nFigure 3: A Cognitive Map for Sizzler \nSource: Author-derived.\n\nSizzler positions itself as a casual diner in the Australian market. Consumers are free to order as much as \nthey like from the self-service counter which includes the daily roast, soup, salad and dessert. Sizzler is \npopular among Australian consumers on account of its value-for-money proposition. When a consumer \nthinks about Sizzler, she connects images of it to other restaurants offering fast food and others that \nprovide dine-in services. In this case, the individual recognises Sizzler as a dine-in establishment. The \nconsumer also believes that Sizzler offers friendly service and that the service is reasonably quick. Next, \nwhen the person thinks of fast service, her thoughts turn to Red Rooster (http:\/\/www.redrooster.com.au\/). \nWhen she thinks of excellent service, she recalls La Porchetta\u2019s restaurant (http:\/\/www.laporchetta.com.\nau\/locations).\n\nCognitive structures contain many linkages and can exist on several levels. For instance, the cognitive \nmap can be basic (like Figure 1) or it can be more spatial and may conjure images of the actual physical \nlocation of Sizzler. Another cognitive level related to Sizzler is the person\u2019s recall of the interior of the \nrestaurant along with other linkages that occur at that level. The consumer can even have thoughts about \nSizzler that focus on employees, including a relationship she had with a server who is a friend. Therefore, \ncognitive processing occurs on many levels using highly complex mechanisms.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/www.redrooster.com.au\/\nhttp:\/\/www.laporchetta.com.au\/locations\nhttp:\/\/www.laporchetta.com.au\/locations\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n37 \n\nPerception\n\nIn terms of new information and cognitive maps, new information is processed in different ways. New \ninformation that is consistent with current information tends to strengthen an existing linkage. For \nexample, when a consumer views a Sizzler advertisement promoting great service, the advertisement \nmay strengthen an existing belief, because the consumer has already concluded that Sizzler offers great \nservice. From a marketing communications perspective, it is easier to strengthen linkages that already \nexist. Adding new linkages or modifying linkages will be more difficult. For example, if a consumer sees \nan advertisement featuring Sizzler\u2019s seafood selection, and the consumer did not know that Sizzler offers \nseafood, a different reaction occurs. In order for this information to remain in the consumer\u2019s mind, the \nconsumer must create a new linkage between previous Sizzler images with images of seafood. \n\n3.2 Learning and memory \n\nMarketers go to great lengths to try and encourage consumers to learn about their products. Consumers must \nlearn almost everything that is related to being a consumer: awareness of a product or a brand, its availability, \nits attributes so on. Learning is a feature of modern life. As consumers, we have to acquire new skills. We are \nliving in the high-tech age, with products life cycles getting shorter all the time and new products are becoming \nmore and more advanced. Hence, marketing managers are very interested in the nature of consumer learning. \nLearning describes changes in an individual\u2019s behavior arising from experience. Learning is defined as any \nchange in the content or organisation of long-term memory (Quester, Pettigrew, Kopanisid and Rao Hill, \n2014). Consumer learning refers to a process by which individuals acquire the purchase and consumption \nknowledge and experience they apply to future related behaviour (Belch, 2012, 142). \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/GTca\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n38 \n\nPerception\n\nThere are three main learning theories that explain how learning takes place: classical conditioning, \noperant conditioning and cognitive learning (Belch, 2012). The classical conditioning theory is \nassociated with the psychologist Pavlov, and in particular, Pavlov\u2019s dog. In this classic experiment, the \nunconditioned stimulus (food) was paired with a conditioned stimulus (the ringing of the bell) and \nwhen the unconditioned stimulus (food) was removed, the dog still salivated at the ringing of the bell. \nLearning through classical conditioning plays an important role in marketing. Buyers can be conditioned \nto form favourable impressions of various brands through this associative learning process. For instance, \njingles that we like will help us recall brands and evoke warm feelings towards the brand. Instrumental \nor operant conditioning is another learning theory. Learning is associated with positive reinforcement \n(reward) or avoiding negative reinforcement (punishment). For example, on Cadbury\u2019s Facebook page, \nthe company claims to have \u201ca passionate commitment to making everyone feel joyful\u201d (https:\/\/www.\nfacebook.com\/CadburyDairyMilkAustralia). Many of its advertisements for chocolate emphasise the \nhedonistic aspects of eating chocolate. Advertising often highlights the benefits (or rewards) a consumer \nwill receive from using the product or service, such as great tasting food, slimness from eating low-fat \nfood, or admiring glances from the opposite sex. For instance, when Lynx launched its latest hair grooming \nproducts for men, viewers of a YouTube advertisement were told that men with great hair get attention \n(http:\/\/www.lynxau.com.au\/). Advertising often encourages consumers to use a particular product or \nbrand to avoid unpleasant consequences, such as social disapproval. Cognitive learning theorists focus \non mental processes such as thinking, evaluation and decision-making. Consumers engage in this type \nof learning when they expend a lot of effort in making decisions and weighing up the pro\u2019s and cons of \nvarious purchase alternatives.\n\nMemory is the total accumulation of prior learning experiences. Short-term memory is the portion of \nmemory that is in use and long-term memory is the portion of memory that provides virtually unlimited, \npermanent storage of information (Quester, Pettigrew, Kopanisid and Rao Hill, 2014, p. 280). Information \nwill be retained in short-term memory for only a few seconds. As stimuli reach an individual\u2019s senses, \nshort-term memory processes them. Short-term memory retains limited pieces of information, meaning \nsome messages are forgotten and others are added to long-term memory. When an organisation attempts \nto introduce consumers to a new brand, repetition of the brand name should occur in marketing \ncommunications. Repetition is important due to the limitations of short-term memory and it improves \nthe chances of recall at a later stage. \n\n3.3 External influences on consumer behaviour\n\nThe previous section discussed internal influences on consumers such as motivation, attitudes and values \nand perception. Consumers do not make purchase decisions in isolation. A number of external factors \nhave been identified than may influence consumer decision making. These are discussed below and are \nhouseholds, culture and reference groups.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CadburyDairyMilkAustralia\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/CadburyDairyMilkAustralia\nhttp:\/\/www.lynxau.com.au\/\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n39 \n\nPerception\n\n3.4 Household decision-making\n\nAs individuals, we consume products such as food, cars, clothes and electronic devices. Researchers in \nthe social sciences have explored individual behaviour and proposed different models of decision making. \nSometimes decisions are made rationally, where consumers weigh up the advantages and disadvantages \nof different products; sometimes our decisions are influenced by emotions or social factors such as \nreference group influence. However, decisions to consume products and services can also be made by \nhouseholds. A husband and wife, and their children, will make decisions to buy various products and \nservices, such a home, furniture, a car, a holiday or energy. \n\nFamily members may assume a variety of roles in the decision-making process. These roles are as follows \n(Belch and Belch, 2012). \n\nThe initiator: the person responsible for initiating the purchase or getting other people to think about \nbuying a particular product or service. In the case of a house, it could be the mother in the family who \nwants more space for a growing family.\n\nThe information provider: the person who gathers information. In the case of a new house purchase, \nthe person with the most time to spare could gather information, such as gathering the property section \nof newspapers, visiting real estate websites and so on.\n\nThe influencer: the person who influences the decision of others. This could be the teenagers in the \nhousehold who have their own needs and preferences, such as the desire for a swimming pool.\n\nThe decision-maker: the person who makes the final decision. This could be the primary income earner \nin the household.\n\nThe buyer or purchasing agent: the person who makes the purchase, such as arranging finance, making \npayment and signing the purchase agreement or contract.\n\nThe users: the people who use the product or service. In the case of a house, all family members are \nusers of the house.\n\nEach role has implications for marketers. First, the marketer must determine who is responsible for the \nvarious roles in the decision-making process so that messages can be directed at the right person. In \nmany cases, marketers will develop different messages for each decision role. For example, Lego may use \nemotional appeals and magical themes in their advertising to appeal to children, who are often influencers \nin the household, but use educational appeals to appeal to parents who are the ultimate decision makers. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n40 \n\nPerception\n\n3.5 Culture \n\nCulture refers to the values, norms and customs shared by a society. Cultures are made up of subcultures, \nsuch as the smaller groups within cultures whose beliefs, values, norms and patterns of behaviour set \nthem apart from mainstream culture. Subcultures can be based on factors such as age, geography, religion \nand ethnicity. \n\nCulture influences what we value and how we define ourselves. At this point in time, concern for the \nnatural environment and interest in socially sustainable practices is becoming more central to our culture. \nWhile sustainable living is not yet the norm and is not yet part of mainstream culture, there are signs \nof change. Marketers are quite interested in spotting cultural shifts or cultural changes as they present \nmarketing opportunities. In Australia, there has been a move from a culture of conspicuous consumption \nin the 1980s to one that increasingly values the environment, resourcefulness and frugality. People are \nlearning to reduce waste, recycle and make choices that don\u2019t damage to the environment such as using \nless water, avoiding plastic, bicycle commuting, walking to work, not littering, buying local.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n                . \n\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/AlcatelLucent\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n41 \n\nPerception\n\nMost observers of the Chinese consumer market have seen it evolve from a traditional culture toward a \nmore Westernized consumer society (Wang and Lin, 2009). To Australian tourism policy makers, China \nis one of the world\u2019s most attractive markets due to its large, emerging middle class and their increased \ndisposable income. Even though only a small fraction of China\u2019s population of 1.3 billion is willing and \nable to travel overseas, the segment is still large and attractive. There has been a shift toward hedonic \nconsumption in China. Chinese consumers, especially young consumers, are inclined to seek fun, \nenjoyment and instant gratification (Wang and Lin, 2009). Through overseas travel, they can satisfy their \nneeds for both esteem and self-actualization. The concept of face, or mianzi, is of central importance in \nChina. Face stands for prestige or reputation that is achieved in life through success and personal effort \n(Hsien, 1944). The concept is relevant to conspicuous consumption such as overseas travel. By traveling \noverseas and bringing home gifts, photographs and other tokens of the trip, the individual can impress \nothers and achieve greater social status.\n\n3.6 Reference groups and opinion leaders\n\nA reference group is a group whose presumed perspectives or values are used by an individual as \nthe basis for his or her judgments, opinions and actions. It has a major influence on our purchase \ndecisions. Within references groups, some individuals act as opinion leaders in that they lead opinion \nand influence others. For instance famous actresses and models often have a major impact on female \nfashion and hairstyles. Celebrities are often role models and exert influence on consumers. Many brands \nuse celebrities to persuade and influence consumers. For instance, featuring a well-known tennis player \nin an ad for a watch can send the message is that if we were to wear the same watch, then we too would \nbe strong, powerful and successful. Many ads create a link between the product and the athlete, and \nstress the charisma, risk-taking, single-mindedness and determination of the athlete, all qualities that \nare needed to achieve success in the sporting field. For example Usain Bolt, said to be the fastest  man \non earth after his performance in the Olympics, is a brand ambassador for Puma (http:\/\/uk.puma.com\/\nen_GB\/sports\/ambassadors\/usain-bolt). Puma\u2019s slogan is \u201cForever Faster Puma\u201d. In 2014, Puma launched \nan advertisement titled \u201cCalling All Troublemakers\u201d where Usain Bolt appears in a hot tub next to \nscantily clad women and with other iconic sportsmen (Sheen, 2014). Bolt calls on all troublemakers, \nadding \u201cobedience will be discouraged\u201d, thereby showing his charismatic and non-conformist personality. \nFurthermore, seeing an athlete endorse a particular brand makes the brand seem more prestigious and \nsuggests that it must be good because a professional uses it.\n\nThere are many external factors that affect consumers\u2019 purchase decisions. Marketers consider all of these \ninfluences in developing marketing communications strategies.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nhttp:\/\/uk.puma.com\/en_GB\/sports\/ambassadors\/usain-bolt\nhttp:\/\/uk.puma.com\/en_GB\/sports\/ambassadors\/usain-bolt\n\n\nConsumer Behaviour and PR\n\n42 \n\nPerception\n\n3.7 Trends in the consumer buying environment\n\nStudying the consumer decision making process can help marketers and be a powerful contributor to \nthe creation of more effective marketing communications. It must be noted that the environment in \nwhich consumption takes place continually changes and evolves. Several trends in the consumer buying \nenvironment affect consumption and purchasing patterns. These are described in the next section.\n\nAge Complexity and Aging of the Population\n\nTechnology has changed the way children grow up. Children are bombarded with advertisements and \nother elements of marketing communications, as well as video games, television shows, films and a myriad \nother images from an early age. Many believe children are \u2018growing up\u2019 too quickly and maturing at a \nmuch earlier age than previous generations. Fashions such as body piercings, tattooing, cropped tops, \nminiskirts and skinny jeans are worn by teenagers and even preteens. Marketers use the term \u201ctweens\u201d \nto describe children who are between childhood and adolescence, aged between the ages of 9 and 12. \nThey spend their pocket money on CDs, computer games, clothing, sports equipment and cosmetics, \nhowever tween consumption and responses to advertising, are likely to vary across cultures (Andersen, \nTufle, Rasmussen and Chan, 2008). This segment is increasingly influenced by young celebrities who \nhave their own fashion labels, such as the Row Label (http:\/\/www.therow.com\/) which was set up in \n2007 by American actresses and fashion designers Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen. The twins made their \nacting debut as infants in the television series Full House (1987) and became the youngest self-made \nmillionaires in American history before they were 10 years old (IMDb, 2015).\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, some adults refuse to \u2018grow old\u2019. They wear fashions that resemble those \nworn by university students. They still go to night clubs, festivals and rock concerts. Many middle-aged \nadults apparently do not want to grow old, acting like younger people and buying products normally \npurchased by them (Clow and Baack, 2010, p. 93). The promotion of products such as age-defying \ncreams, weight loss products and cosmetic surgery is now commonplace. This trend challenges marketers \nto create messages that reflect behaviour but do not offend or confuse more traditional middle-aged \npeople. For instance Cochlear, well known for its cochlear implants, a technology that helps restore \nhearing, has to be careful not to offend the baby boomer segment. Traditionally, senior citizens have \nassumed that as they get older, they will get deaf and there is nothing to prevent that from happening \n(Cochlear, 2003). Today, baby boomers are less tolerant of disability. Since chronological age is often \nnot a good indicator of a person\u2019s \u2018cognitive\u2019 age (the age they feel they are), marketers need to consider \nhow best to communicate with this segment.

Memorize them and apply them, and you will accomplish much. \nBut, get beyond them and you will accomplish so much more.\n\nINSIGHT #1: The customer is the ultimate competitor.\n\nOVERCOME #1: Make the customer a collaborator.\n\nWhen you came up with that first idea, the ur-product, and beat a path to the marketplace, alas there \nwas someone who had gotten there first. He is the first customer. Before you even thought to meet his \nneeds with a product or service, he was thinking about meeting his own needs.\n\n\u2022\t Before there was a restaurant, he fixed his own meals.\n\u2022\t Before there was a cannery, he preserved his own food.\n\u2022\t Before there was a dry cleaner, he ironed his own pants.\n\u2022\t Before Bekins bought its first van, people were moving themselves.\n\u2022\t Before anyone attempted to make a living painting other people\u2019s homes, people painted \n\ntheir own.\n\u2022\t Before there was Twitter and Facebook, he sent an email to his friends and attached some \n\npictures.\n\u2022\t Before there was a truck bedliner or a cargo net, he positioned blankets and tarps around \n\nthe loads in the back of his pickup truck, and then tied them down with rope.\n\u2022\t Before there was TV guide, he wrote down the programs in order, hoping that next week \n\nwould have a similar sequence.\n\nThis is not just a story about times past. This basic competitor is always there, now more so than ever \nin the cyber age. Once upon a time I had a travel agent. He was friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and \ndedicated, everything one would want a travel agent to be. It was always a pleasure to enter his office \nacross from the Redlands YMCA. He and his wife put in long hours, thinking that they were building \na future business that, perhaps, they could hand down to the next generation. On so many occasions, \nhis efforts paid off for me: a cheaper flight, a more convenient schedule, an extra perk here and there.\n\nBut then I discovered how to use the internet for myself. First it was just the Southwest Airlines site: \nso much more convenient and empowering than talking to a reservations agent on the other end of \nthe line, so much better than\u2026a trip to the office of my own travel agent. Then I found those sites, like \nPriceline, that enabled me to take the lead in the price negotiation. My flirt with them did not last long, \nbut it was an important step in my independence from the travel agent.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n8 \n\nFace Your Ultimate Competitor\n\nThat great guy and his wife, my personal travel agents, went out of business a few years ago. Where \ntheir office used to be there is now one of those comedic driving schools (where people pass an evening \nor a Saturday afternoon in order to avoid having a traffic ticket on their driving records). I miss him. \nHe was a pleasant fellow, and oh so competent and dedicated. At times, I wonder what he is doing. He \ncould beat the competition of all the other travel agents, but he just could not beat me serving myself.\n\nYahoo figured out how to walk me through searching by fare and then nailing down the date. Yahoo \nempowered me to do it my way, not the airline way of \u201ctell us a date and we will give you a hard and fast \nprice.\u201d Yahoo has my business now, until someone else figures out how to better empower me.\n\nIndeed, the best way to innovate is to still observe what people are trying to do for themselves: just make \nit better, faster, cheaper and more convenient. Because it is the customer who is the real competition, \nproduct and promotion must dance to the consumer\u2019s tune. \n\nHelping the customer do his own thing better is an art. There are many rules of etiquette, but the course \nto success is largely un-chartered and strewn with the wrecks of overly ambitious firms. More sales are \nlost through obnoxious sales techniques than are won through the most energetic sales techniques. \n\nA poor sales technique is to try to make the customer feel inferior about attempting to take care of his \nown needs with his own creative efforts. Showing the customer that his techniques are ineffective is \nan insult. Somehow, you assume that he should be so grateful for such insults that he will want to pay \nyou for the privilege of giving up on his efforts. In fact, buying is antithetical to what most people want \nto do. They may experience uneasiness explaining their purchasing decision to other people, even to \nthemselves. Give people a reason to buy and an excuse for buying.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like to be sold, but they love to buy.\u201d \n\u2013 Jeffrey Gitomer\n\nSelling must never be manipulating, selling must appear to be harmonizing. Chris DeNove and James \nD. Power in their book Satisfaction: how every great company listens to the voice of the customer, gave \nthe example of car dealerships. The under-performing ones were using high pressure tactics and found \nthemselves in a vicious cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy. Their mantra was that if the customer was not \nsold a car on his first visit, he would walk at that door and go somewhere else. So, salesmen turned up \nthe pressure to make the sale today. The customers who did walk away certainly did not come back to \nthat obnoxious dealership, thus making it look like its analysis of the situation had been correct.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n9 \n\nFace Your Ultimate Competitor\n\nEvery product and every commodity is really just a service, the service of manufacturing and delivering \nthat product in a way that the customer will find to be\n\n1. of higher quality\n2. at a cheaper price, and\/or\n3. more convenient\n\nthan if the customer would have made that same product for himself. \n\nThe greatest competitor is always the customer doing it for himself. When the customer looks at the \neconomics of do-it-yourself he is not looking at the cost of your product versus that of another competitor\u2019s \nproduct. He is measuring the overall experience of you providing the service with the overall experience \nof doing it himself. He is not deterred by the time factor, unless he perceives the provision of do-it-\nyourself time as excruciating, or he perceives a more pleasant and prosperous use of alternative time.\n\nFor example, my wife spends hours working in her garden, planting flowers, watering and pulling weeds. \nAt times, she does complain about the long hours and physical strain. We could sell that big house on \nthe big lot and get a smaller condominium so she would have less yard work, but that is not what she \nwants. We could hire someone to do the planting, weeding, and watering, but the truth is, that is her \nmajor source of recreation. As it turns out, we have a gardener who comes once a week. He mows the \nlawn and trims the bushes (things that my wife has no interest in doing). His gardening service meets \nour needs because it permits us to have a large house with a garden, and makes my wife\u2019s time in the \ngarden more pleasant.\n\nWinning the marketing battle does not begin with creating a comeback customer who returns from the \ntemptation of the competition. Winning begins with luring the customer who does it himself.\n\nMarketing is all about a relationship with that self-serving customer. The essence of having a customer \nis the relationship, a relationship in which when the customer has a need, a question, or a concern, the \ncustomer comes to your company, instead of starting from the beginning of an information search. A \ngood relationship also means that the customer will look at information from you even when he does \nnot have a question or perceive a need.\n\nEvery aspect of business is an interpersonal relationship involving delegation of tasks. The customer \ndelegates to the producer a task, either a direct service or the extraction of a commodity or the production \nof a manufactured good. (So, in this sense, every producer\u2019s greatest competition is the customer who \ndoes the task himself; e.g., moving, painting, gardening).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n10 \n\nFace Your Ultimate Competitor\n\nThe employer delegates to the employee a task, which the employer could either do himself, or invest in \na machine to do it. (So, in this sense, a job for someone else is only created when the producer decides \nto become an employer and get someone else to do part of the work of his company.)\n\nAll of these transactions require cooperation, and are economically just if all parties have free choice \nand are properly informed of the implications of their decisions.\n\nAt its core, all business is cooperation rather than competition. The only competition between companies \nis to see which one will do the best job of cooperating with the customer. The only competition between \nworkers is to see which one will cooperate with the employer the most (and unions try to short circuit \nthis competition by agreeing that no worker will cooperate with the employer unless the other workers \nagree).\n\nThe only way to succeed in business is to get and keep these do-it-yourself customers. As soon as the \ncustomer realizes that you are there to sell him instead of help him do it himself, he no longer welcomes \nyou as a friend, but ignores you as an annoyance.\n\nMarcus Buckingham of the Gallup Organization wrote about basic personality strengths: The One Thing \nYou Need to Know. It is essential for counseling people about their vocations, and business owners about \nwhat product or service their business should become involved with. Buckingham\u2019s advice can be summed \nup in one sentence: \u201cDiscover what you don\u2019t like doing and stop doing it.\u201d\n\nBut that is the also the key to understanding the consumer, and a company\u2019s role with the consumer. \nEach consumer is trying to figure out what he does not want to do, like my wife who loves watering and \nweeding, but not some other aspects of garden maintenance. Victor saw her in the yard one day fighting \nwith the trimmers and they struck a deal and as long as he does well what she does not want to do, he \nhas a customer. The purpose of a business is to make the customer\u2019s life better by removing an unpleasant \ntask. Do it consistently and you keep your customer. Do it well, and you will generate some buzz: he \ntells his family, friends, and neighbors how they can improve their lives by trying this new business. If \nthe customer cannot figure out how your sales message is relevant to improving his life, you are zapped.\n\nI am not your customer for so many things. You don\u2019t cook my food, operate my computer or drive my \ncar or walk my dog. As long as I regard these as pleasures for myself to enjoy, or as so complicated and \nessential that I trust no one else to do them, I will not be your customer.\n\nTo get my business, you have to give me what I want, and your product does not have a clue.\n\n\u201cYou can get whatever you want, if you help enough people get what they want.\u201d \n\u2013 Zig Ziglar\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n11 \n\nFace Your Ultimate Competitor\n\nSo, who is a good salesman?

One of the main motives for \nbuying a bigger house or constructing another addition must be more storage space for all the stuff.

What has this \nphenomenon done to the furniture industry?\n\nHere is another great example of people doing something for themselves (and another great opportunity \nfor someone to create a business to help homeowners do it better). Another business stemming from \nthis has been the rental of storage space, but still junk accumulates faster, and hence, the need for garage \nsales.

Only by intensifying the consumer\u2019s rejection thinking \ncan you get him to take a fresh perspective on your product or service.\n\nEveryday, you and millions of other potential consumers make thousands of decisions. You are not \nconsciously aware of most of the decisions you make, but you make most of them the same way, by \nreflecting on the drawbacks involved, and then picking that course of action with the fewest drawbacks (or \nthe least painful ones). Herbert Simon, a Nobel Prize winning economist, referred to this as \u201csatisficing.\u201d \nInstead of optimizing satisfaction, and choosing an outstanding product in terms of its aspects in one \nparticular area, we compromise on the best so that we do not get the worst in some other aspect. We \ndon\u2019t settle for the best in one area, but the least bad in all areas.\n\nThe only way to understand how consumers make decisions is that they do not accentuate the \u201cpositive,\u201d \nbut the \u201cnegative.\u201d The process of making a decision is not about including more options and facets, \nbut about exclusion. The analogy is one of a funnel with a lot of screens and filters inside: a lot may be \npoured in at the top, but only a small amount makes it all the way through to the end point (the decision \nby the consumer to purchase the product).\n\nWhen I go from my home on Acapulco\u2019s Westside to downtown, I must make a quick decision about how \nto get there. Usually, there is at least one car in my driveway, but I hate fighting the traffic (concern #1) \nand looking for a parking place (concern #2). Private taxis are expensive (concern #3), but the collective \ntaxis here in Acapulco pack you in Nissan sardine tins (concern #4). So, I usually take the bus because it \nhas the fewest undesirable features. But some days I want to get downtown more quickly, so the slowness \nof the bus becomes a more salient concern, or I know that I will have to carry something back, and the \nidea of juggling packages while standing as the bus goes around those curves looks like a more serious \nproblem. While the bus usually wins, it only wins until its undesirables outweigh those of the other \nmodes of transportation.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n15 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nI have long wondered why any tourist anywhere (but especially an American tourist in Mexico) would \nopt for something called the all-inclusive. It works something like this. You pay one price, everything \nup front. That includes the transportation from the airport to the resort (usually outside of town), hotel \nroom for a week, three meals a day, onsite night life for entertainment, sometimes even all you can \ndrink. In most places, you don\u2019t have to carry money, just wear this little plastic identification band on \nyour wrist, and you eat and drink all day long. The AI resorts are good, but not the best, and certainly \nnot worth what they charge for them. The food is healthy, decent, but not the finest that the destination \ncity offers. The \u201cnightlife\u201d is usually a house band that plays unobjectionable music, but keep in mind \nthat the house band was not good enough to get a booking at one of the destination nightclubs. I have \nlong wracked my brain: why would anyone pay so much to spend a boring vacation in one of these all \ninclusives? Even if the music and the food were first rate, wouldn\u2019t you get tired of it after five nights? \n\nIn Acapulco, for example, there are so many restaurants and nightclubs downtown, why would anyone pay \nso much for boring, mediocre fare? And then the obvious decision factors hit me. People who choose an \nall-inclusive are not trying to get the best. The attraction of the AI is not what it has, but what it avoids: \nthe need to get into a taxi and find a restaurant, then find a nightclub, then come back to the hotel. \n\u201cJust good enough\u201d satisfices and is the preferred option if it allows us to avoid the unfavorable factors.\n\nHow did you vote in the last Congressional election? Did you really think the candidate who got your \nvote was the best possible person to represent you on national and international affairs? the best that \nyour party could offer? Did you wish someone else had been running? Most voters do not think of \nthemselves as voting \u201cfor\u201d either candidate, but as voting \u201cagainst\u201d the other, choosing the lesser of two \nevils. Indeed, campaign research indicates that the most effective ads tend to be the hit pieces that attack \nan opponent. How did the Republicans end up selecting Mitt Romney in 2012? Probably the best reasons \nwere that he seemed to be the lesser evil among his field of candidates. He spent heavily on negative ads \nin the primaries, but got beat in November when the Democrats spent more on negative ads against \nhim. Remember Newt Gingrich, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry? Mitt Romney did not look more forceful \nor clear on the issues, he just looked less objectionable (and possibly, therefore, more electable, than \nany of the Republican also-rans).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n16 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nWhen you moved to a new city, how did you select your church?

Say you were a Baptist in the old city. You look around your new neighborhood. \nDown the block you notice there is a Catholic Church, a Synogogue, a Mosque and a Buddhist Temple: \nwrong doctrines. Next block there are Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists and Presbyterians: they \ndon\u2019t baptize the right way. Then there is a Spanish Language Baptist Church: wrong language. There is \na Pentecostal Church close by: too loud, you think. You tried the First Baptist Church (no youth group), \nand the Second Baptist Church (too ethnic), then the Third Baptist Church (but the wife says too many \nold ladies who gossip), and the Fourth Baptist Church (boring preacher), and the Fifth Baptist (services \ntoo late in the day).

University of California Riverside? Don\u2019t tell me that there was something \nso attractive about the city that drew you there inexorably. Your decision was a process of elimination. \nYou first thought of UCLA, but the commute would be too tough. University of Redlands was too hard \nto get into. Cal Baptist was too expensive and not forthcoming on that scholarship. University of Phoenix \nwas all over southern California, but you had some standards. Cal State San Bernardino was affordable \nand close, but you heard that it was hard to get the courses you needed to graduate on time. So, you went \nto University of California Riverside even though it was not the best school in your particular field, the \nclosest or the cheapest. You chose UCR simply because you had good reasons for not going elsewhere, \nand UCR survived the process of elimination. Its unfavorables were more tolerable.\n\nToo many marketers think like street vendors. Their pitch involves a brief focus on one attractive point \nabout their product. Take a walk with me some Sunday afternoon, around the Toluca Portales. So many \nhappy couples and families; so many opportunities for street vendors. The balloon vendor attracts a \ncrowd by making a sound of a strange bird. The popcorn vendor makes the sound of a steam whistle. \nThe churro vendor sells not so much on sight, as by the smell of the donutty mixture hitting the hot \noil. And then there is the vendor of the little wind up toys. The child sees one and wants it. All of these \nvendors hope that their potential customers will think just like four year olds, overly impressed with \nthe first impression attractive aspect of the product, making a purchase decision before the unfavorables \ncome into their minds.\n\nThe adult decision maker can\u2019t keep the unfavorables from jumping into his mind and dominating his \ndecision. The adult decision maker sees the cute helium balloon and thinks, we are going to mass in ten \nminutes, and do I want this balloon of a red devil soaring above me at church?\n\nThe adult decision maker sees the popcorn, churro or snowcone vendor and thinks: will the kid be done \neating in ten minutes? Probably not, so don\u2019t buy it now. Of course, when the family gets out of church \nis not a better time, because then they have to go to Aunt Maria\u2019s for Sunday dinner.\n\nThen the adult decision maker contemplates that wind up toy. His child\u2019s initial fascination is more than \nmatched by these sober calculations: is it a safety risk? will it break before he loses interest (in which \ncase junior will start to cry)? or will he lose interest before he breaks it? (in which case it was not a very \ngood investment either), will junior be making noise with this toy all during mass? The adult does not \nhave to come up with ten good reasons for not buying the toy: one is sufficient to veto the purchase.\n\nThis rejection mind-frame dominates the vast majority of product decisions that adults make.

Each time I fly, I think how much \n\nI would like to avoid it. Most of these reasons are just reasons \n\nto avoid flying in general, but some reasons translate into avoiding \n\nspecific airlines.\n\n1. Those baggage limits bother me. Sometimes I want to bring \n\nmore weight, more bags, an oddly shaped bag, or a live \n\nanimal. Several times I have driven two thousand miles just \n\nso that I could bring something with me that I knew the \n\nairlines would bother me about. (Opportunity talking: if an \n\nairline just relaxed those baggage limits, they could get my \n\nbusiness, at least on certain occasions.)\n\n2. Losing Luggage. The only thing worse than not being able \n\nto bring luggage is to bring it, check it, only to have it \n\nlost. One airline (United) in particular has lost so much of \n\nmy luggage I shall not give them another chance, even if the \n\nflight were free.\n\n3. Getting to the airport is a hassle. I hate those shuttles. \n\nThey arrive early, or late, and the drivers go like crazy to \n\nmake the next pickup. \n\n4. Parking at the airport is a worse hassle (which is the only \n\nreason I even consider the shuttles).\n\n5. I have to revisit the whole transportation hassle when I \n\narrive at my destination. I would prefer to drive 300 miles \n\nto Phoenix from Redlands just so that I have my own car \n\nthere when I arrive.\n\n6. The food on the planes (and in the airport) is so bad that \n\nI started packing my own food even before some airlines \n\nstopped providing meal service.\n\nAIRPORTS: I hate using airports, but as with airlines, I have to, in \n\norder to avoid the alternatives. Nevertheless, there are hundreds of \n\nairports that I have never used, and probably never will. It would \n\nbe more precise to say that there are only a handful of airports \n\non my list of potentials.

Maybe the airport is close to my destination \n\ncity, but my departure city is not on the other end of a \n\nroute that it services.\n\n3. Wrong airline. Some airports are limited to a few airlines. \n\nIf they are the airlines that I refuse to fly (because \n\nof their unfavorables), then I have no reason to use the \n\nairport.\n\n4. Too far. They are building a new airport for the Mexico City \n\narea, and putting it east of the city in Texcoco.

At some places (e.g., LAX) the parking is just too \n\nconfusing. At other places (e.g., Tijuana) there just are \n\nnot enough long term spots.\n\n8. Public transportation. LAX strikes out again. There\u2019s no way \n\nI can just catch a public bus that takes me close to home.\n\n9. Too far between connections. This is not just a function \n\nof size. Some relatively small airports put way too much \n\ndistance between connections.\n\n10. Too confusing. LAX strikes out again. Why a \u201cBradley \n\nterminal\u201d instead of numbers or letters?

There were many barriers which \n\nwere eventually removed, but some financial institution could have sped \n\nup the process and got a new customer by removing these more quickly.\n\n1. Complicated. At least initially, it was confusing going \n\nthrough the different screens. I could have overcome this in \n\nfive minutes if some bank had set up an ATM inside the branch \n\nand had an attendant walk me through the steps.\n\n2. Fear of getting mugged. There are still some locations I \n\nwill not go to even in the day. One brilliant move was \n\nputting ATMs in side of public places (like malls and police \n\nstations).\n\n3. Fear of bank errors. My wife had a bad experience with a \n\ndebit card, so I cancelled that card, and just have the \n\nregular ATM with no Visa logo. I once went to a new bank to \n\nopen an account, spending over a half hour with the paper \n\nwork, and then the deal breaker emerged. This bank only had \n\ndebit cards, no plain ATM. I cancelled the new account.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n21 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\n4. Tellers are easier. For the first ten years of the ATM, many \n\ncustomers concluded that tellers were still less fearful \n\nand less risky. One bank (Bank of America) actually decided \n\nto pull tellers off the line in order to encourage its \n\ncustomers to use the ATM. (Of course, the long lines also \n\nencouraged many of its customers to check out the other \n\nbanks as well.)\n\nBANKS: I have accounts at a dozen different banks, and I am a former \n\ncustomer with as many. There are some banks I will never be a customer \n\nof (and some I will never be a customer again). Here are the rejection \n\nfactors determining my selection of banks.\n\n1. Location. This is a deal breaker. I will never be a customer \n\nof the First Bank of Tulsa because I have never been there \n\nand will probably never live or conduct business there. Even \n\na southern California bank, with too few locations, would \n\nnot become one of my banks.\n\n2. Bad teller service. As I conduct more of my banking online, \n\nby mail, or by ATM, I need fewer and fewer teller contacts, \n\nbut when I need to see a teller, I want prompt and effective \n\nservice. One bad experience of service is usually sufficient \n\nfor me to cancel the account.\n\nBATTERIES: I hate batteries, the kind you have to put in flashlights \n\nand small appliances. I love my solar powered radio because it does \n\nnot use batteries. Consider the unfavorables of batteries.\n\n1. Shelf life. You never know how long they will last. More \n\nspecifically: too often when you take them out of the package \n\nand put them in the device, they no longer work.\n\n2. Wrong size. I don\u2019t understand the need for all the \n\ndifferent sizes. All I know is, when I need some batteries, \n\nthat\u2019s the size I don\u2019t have, while I have all these stocks \n\nof dead batteries which have not been used because they are \n\nthe wrong size.\n\n3.

I don\u2019t own a boat bigger than an \n\ninflatable Sevylor. The temptation is great, because in Long Beach I \n\nlive right by the yacht harbor. The favorables are all there, but \n\nso are the compelling unfavorables (which might explain why they say \n\nthat the two happiest days in the life of a boat owner are the day \n\nhe buys his boat, and the day he sells it).\n\n1. Cost. Yes, all of these water toys are expensive to \n\npurchase.\n\n2. Maintenance. All of these require regular maintenance and\/or \n\nrepairs, everything from refinishing the deck to changing the \n\noil in the motor. The greatest motivation for maintenance is \n\nthat without it, when you arrive at your water destination \n\nwith your boat, it does not work. (Of course, sometimes that \n\nhappens even when you kept up with the maintenance.)\n\n3. Training. As they get more complicated to operate and \n\nmaintain, they require more training. The only reason people \n\nget the training is that when they try to do without the \n\ntraining, the level of frustration is much higher (and \n\npeople avoid the unfavorables).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nwww.discovermitas.com\n\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/mitas\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n23 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\n4. Storage. Everything has to be somewhere, and when the boat \n\nis not in the middle of the water with you at the helm, it \n\nhas to be somewhere else, perhaps a berth, perhaps in your \n\ngarage or backyard. That is a cost of money and\/or space.\n\n5. Transportation. If the boat is not stored in the water, it \n\nmust be stored somewhere else and brought to the water. You \n\nwill need a trailer and an apparatus of getting the boat \n\ninto and out of the water.\n\n6. Dangerous. Regardless of the amount of training and \n\nmaintenance, boats are accidents waiting to happen, accidents \n\nin an environment which humans are unlikely to survive.\n\n7. A better alternative. Renting a boat when you get there \n\nseems to avoid problems 1,2,4, and 5 and maybe the guy \n\nrenting it to you will give you an impromtu version of \n\nthe essentials of #3 training, and hopefully, he carries \n\ninsurance for #6.\n\nCABLE: For a long time I didn\u2019t have cable TV service at my Redlands \n\nhouse, and still do not have it at Acapulco or Long Beach.\n\n1. No time to watch TV. The first thing that popped into my mind \n\nwhen I see an ad for cable is: \u201cI don\u2019t have the time to \n\nwatch all of those channels.\u201d My situation changed when my \n\naged father moved in with me and spent most of his waking \n\nhours in front of the television.\n\n2. Installation. I knew it is too complicated to do myself, and \n\nI heard that it is a problem coordinating the right time \n\nwith the cable company. Verizon\u2019s easy installation convinced \n\nme.\n\n3. Pricing. I have heard that they start you off with low rates \n\nand then jack them up after you have become accustomed to \n\nthe service. Verizon finally gave me a great deal. \n\n4. Alternatives. There was broadcast TV, until it went digital \n\nand I had to deal with the unfavorable of those conversion \n\nboxes. Also Fox kept putting on those \u201creality\u201d shows and \n\namateur talent shows, so those unfavorables got too high.\n\n5. Disreputable companies. I had heard too many stories about \n\npoor service. Finally, I found a company (Verzion) that gave \n\nme good phone and FIOS internet service, so I decided to try \n\nthem for TV. \n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n24 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nCELL PHONE: When they came out, I tried one for a couple of months, \n\nbut got rid of it. \n\n1. Too complicated. Forget all the bells and whistles. Just \n\ngive me an on\/off switch, a dial tone, and big buttons. That \n\nmight make me a late adopter psychographic that is on the \n\nwane.\n\n2. Carrying. Maybe the young generation likes to wear these on \n\ntheir belts as a fashion statement, but I still don\u2019t have a \n\nplace for it.\n\n3. Charging. We are back to the battery thing again. Why can\u2019t \n\nit just get charged by the sunlight or by the natural \n\nmovement of my body?\n\n4. Sound quality. I couldn\u2019t hear the voice on the other end \n\nhalf of the time. The newer phones are better.\n\n5. Risk of loss, theft. I never really had it lost or stolen, \n\nbut I was always misplacing it (once again, it never had a \n\nconvenient place for carrying or even storage.)\n\nPhone companies kept missing the target by coming up with new attractive \n\nfeatures: how thin! how colorful! what interesting ringtones! Sorry, it \n\nwas not until I found how Trumpet Mobile took care of the unfavorables \n\nthat I bought another cell phone. But then the battery went out, and \n\nI couldn\u2019t get it replaced. Hello, smartphone.\n\nE-BOOK READER: Many publishers have tried to convince my students \n\nthat instead of buying traditional textbooks, a better alternative \n\nwould be to purchase an e-book reader and then \u201ccartridges\u201d for the \n\nspecific textbooks (at about half price) needed that semester. The \n\nway the salesmen calculate, the average student could save hundreds \n\nof dollars over a four year education. Most students have balked at \n\nthis sales pitch, and I think they are demonstrating caution based \n\nupon perceived unfavorables.\n\n1. Complicated. Any new technology is complicated, and the \n\nstudent fears not being able to use it. Until a critical \n\nmass of students start using it, and then showing each other \n\nhow to use it, the salesmen may have to demo the use of \n\ne-books.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n25 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\n2. Lack of compatible cartridges. It is not sufficient to say \n\nthat some or even most textbooks will be available on \n\ncartridges. If one professor requires one textbook without a \n\ncartridge, the student has to go back to purchasing the old \n\nstyle textbook.\n\n3. Resale value. Students see their textbooks as an investment \n\nas well as a cost. Unless a new edition is coming out, \n\nstudents know that they can resell their textbooks at the \n\nend of the semester, and get up to half their money back.\n\n4. Alternative: used textbooks. What the salespeople fail \n\nto understand is that the e-books are not just competing \n\nagainst the new hundred dollar textbooks, but in most cases, \n\nagainst the fifty dollar used textbooks.\n\nFLASHLIGHT: I hate flashlights.

Usually, I need the \n\nlight so that I can perform some task with my hands. I want \n\na flashlight I can position, or at least set down without \n\nrolling away. \n\nFLOWERS: I no longer buy flowers to send to my wife or mother. Flowers \n\nhave too many problems.\n\n1. They die. I guess that\u2019s part of them being fresh and \n\nperishable.\n\n2. Delivery. On those few occasions when I used to purchase \n\nflowers, delivery time was the key: on Valentine\u2019s Day, not \n\nthe 15th of February; on my anniversary, not the day after.\n\n3. Flower shops were all concerned about their attractive \n\nfeatures: \u201clook how festive this arrangement is\u201d and never \n\nabout my concerns. Sorry, flowers are not worth it for me.\n\nMORTGAGES: I think I have seen more mortgage refinance ads than any \n\nother kind over the last decade. I have mentally zapped every one for \n\nthe same reason: I don\u2019t have any more mortgages. Only when I started \n\nto think, \u201cI could borrow money on the Redlands home and buy another \n\nfor cash in a great down market\u201d did I start listening to the ads.\n\nHOTELS: We select hotels by a process of elimination.\n\n1. Location. I don\u2019t need a hotel in Lawrence, Kansas: I\u2019m not \n\ngoing there.\n\n2. Ease of finding. I rarely make reservations anymore, \n\nespecially on driving trips into Mexico. Too many hotels are \n\nsimply too hard to find. So, I prefer to keep driving until I \n\nfind a hotel that looks acceptable.\n\n3. Getting there. When I am flying into a city, one thing I have \n\nto worry about is getting to the hotel. I have even stayed \n\nat boring airport hotels, simply because they were easier to \n\nget to. Hint: having a free shuttle to the airport overcomes \n\nthis unfavorable and is a major deal maker.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n27 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\n4. Wait staff hassles. I don\u2019t want to have to summon a bell \n\nhop to show me how to work the air conditioning or give me \n\na glass of water. I want all the conveniences in my room and \n\navailable from the outset.\n\nDIAL UP INTERNET: We all started this way, but most of us did not \n\nstay because of the problems. \n\n1. Too slow. As we perceived the need to do more (e.g., \n\ndownload music) we needed more bandwidth. \n\n2. Telephone line. Remember your Aunt Ethyl trying to call up \n\nand she kept getting the business signal because you were \n\nonline? Juno solved that problem by allowing you to download \n\nyour email and work with it offline, so Juno had my email \n\nbusiness for many years.\n\nJEWELRY: I hate it and never buy it or wear it.\n\n1. No need. The first thing that crosses my mind about jewelry \n\nis that I don\u2019t need it.\n\n2. Risk. Here is something small and valuable, too vulnerable \n\nto loss and theft, which means I have to find a safe space \n\nto store it, and then insure it.\n\n3. Inheritance. If the jewelry is so valuable that it becomes a \n\nfamily heirloom, that I have to worry about who will inherit \n\nit, and what I tell my other heirs?\n\nJUICER, FOOD PROCESSOR: We see their attractive features demonstrated \n\non the infomercials, but I never think past the unfavorables.\n\n1.

Most pieces of luggage have one or \n\nmore of the following problems.\n\n1. Too small (at least for what I want to carry).\n\n2. Too large (at least for where I have to put it).\n\n3. Not durable (at least according to what airline travel \n\nrequires).\n\n4. Does not protect the contents. Too often I have to place my \n\nthings inside of hard boxes or cans inside of the luggage. \n\n5. Not flexible in size. What I need to pack does not match the \n\ndimensions of the luggage.\n\n6. Hard to carry. Why did it take so many years to invent \n\nwheels and handles? \n\n7. Hard to find things inside. I know it is in this bag, but \n\nwhere?\n\nMOVIE THEATER: It is a rare occasion that I visit a U.S. theater \n\nto watch a movie. As much as I love movies, there are too many \n\nunfavorables, and it only takes one of these to keep me away.\n\n1. Theater is too far.\n\n2. Theater is showing the wrong movie.\n\n3. Ticket prices are too high.\n\n4. Popcorn is too salty.\n\n5. Popcorn is too pricey.\n\n6. Parking is too difficult.\n\n7. Audiences are too obnoxious.\n\nThe alternative just gets rid of so many unfavorables: I\u2019ll wait a \n\nfew months and rent it on Netflix.\n\nMILK: I have just about ended purchasing milk in the U.S.\n\n1. Shelf life. I am only going to be there for a few days, and \n\nit hardly seems worth it. I won\u2019t be able to finish it.\n\n2. Complicated types.

Lessons are expensive and inconvenient. I remember when my \n\ndaughter was learning, we had to readjust our schedules to \n\naccommodate for the music lessons. Never again! \n\nPET FOOD: I love cats, but I don\u2019t have one now. One factor deterring \n\nme from ever having one again would be the hassles of pet food.\n\n1. Expensive. At some times, I think it cost more to feed the \n\ncat than to feed me.\n\n2. Cat won\u2019t eat it. She was finicky, and we never knew if she \n\nwould eat what we had bought.\n\n3. Smells bad.\n\n4. Hard to clean. Those special dishes were cute, but difficult \n\nto clean.\n\n5. Hard to open, more difficult than containers of people food. \n\nWas this designed to keep the cats out? Well, it kept the \n\npeople out, so I changed at least one brand because of this.\n\n6. Containers too big. Hint: how about a meal sized container \n\nso that I don\u2019t have to refrigerate the remainder? (which \n\nshe wouldn\u2019t eat anyway because it is dry, cold, and hard). \n\n7.

The reason is simple: the \n\ndownsides of public transportation outweigh the downsides of driving.\n\n1. Routing.

Proximity to undesirable people. Most of the people I meet \n\non a bus I would not invite into my home.\n\n6. Stations, platforms and stops are unappealing, places I \n\ndon\u2019t want to be.\n\n7. Drivers who won\u2019t stop, make change, or give information. \n\nWhat a difference from Mexican bus drivers! There the driver \n\nrents the bus and gets to keep the fare.

Yet, most stations I have never listened \n\nto, and will never listen to. I make my decisions on the basis of the \n\nunfavorables: eliminating those stations that do not meet my criteria.\n\n1. Wrong location. There might be some great North Dakota \n\nstations, but I never get close enough to pick them up.\n\n2. Poor reception. There are some great stations that just do \n\nnot come in clear enough; sorry KNX 1070, you don\u2019t serve \n\nthe Inland Empire.\n\n3. Wrong programming. If you\u2019re playing rap, I\u2019m not listening.\n\n4. Too many commercials. If it sounds like a long block, I\u2019m \n\nswitching to another channel. \n\n5. Obnoxious commercials.

Storage. I am not going to be driving it most of the time. \n\nIt looks too big for my driveway or garage, so does it take \n\nup most of my backyard?\n\n2. Gas mileage. Just how much does it cost to drive a hundred \n\nmiles?\n\n3. It looks hard to steer.\n\n4. Overnight hook up fees at trailer park. Now its starts to \n\ncompare unfavorably with its main alternative: the hotel.\n\nRENTAL CARS: It has been many years since I have rented a car at my \n\ntravel destination. The unfavorables are simply too great.\n\n1. Cost. The basic cost of per day or per mile would be \n\ntolerable, but there are those add ons: taxes, insurance, \n\ngas refilling. You never know what you are going to have to \n\npay. \n\n2. Hard to get to pick up site or home from drop off site. The \n\nwhole point is that I am starting off and ending up without \n\na car. This is usually a deal breaker.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n33 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\n3. Wait for a car. One firm permanently lost my business because \n\nI had to wait for half an hour to have a car ready. (I \n\nhad made a reservation and arrived on time.) The excuse \n\nI got was \u201cthe car is being vacuumed\u201d). That sounded like \n\n\u201cthe check is in the mail\u201d and why didn\u2019t they ask me my \n\npreference: dirty car now or clean car later. Time was my \n\nkey concern, and waiting for it was an intolerable factor.\n\n4. Downtown parking. After I have the car, where do I put it \n\nwhen I am not driving?\n\n5. Alternatives. The more I used rental cars, the better the \n\nalternatives looked: taxi, public transportation, local \n\nfriends. I have even driven out of state instead of flying \n\nsimply because I would rather have my own car at the \n\ndestination rather than relying upon a rental car.\n\nRESTAURANT: I don\u2019t eat in restaurants that often, but when I do, I \n\nselect solely on the avoidance of unfavorables.\n\n1. Location. The restaurant has to be in a location convenient \n\nto where I am or where I can get to. Few restaurants have \n\nsuch compelling features that I am going to drive there and \n\nlook for them. \n\n2. Type of food. Ninety percent of restaurants offer food \n\nthat I prefer to avoid. I scratch them off my list. Other \n\ncustomers scratch restaurants off their lists because of \n\nfood aversions, religious objections, etc.\n\n3. Wait staff. Some are too slow, some are too surly or too \n\naggressive. The buffet alternative looks better and better \n\nto me, especially because I also get to see the food.\n\n4. Price. In addition to being too expensive, some places will \n\nnot accept credit cards.\n\n5. Fear of fraud. Especially with foreign restaurants, there is \n\na growing fear that some employee will take the credit card \n\nnumber and use it fraudulently.\n\nSOUVENIRS: Around Acapulco I see these intricately made models of \n\npirate ships and these great terra cotta sculptures.

Some stores are too far away, and just not worth \n\nthe drive, even for an expected savings on price. (Sorry, \n\nSafeway, you\u2019re not close enough).\n\n2. Too expensive. Some stores have earned a reputation of \n\ncharging too much on too many items. I just don\u2019t go to \n\nthose places anymore. (Sorry, Albertsons, Ralphs, Vons.)\n\n3. Waiting in line. Some stores are associated with long lines \n\n(Sorry, Stater Brothers).\n\n4. Cannot find what I need, get in and get out quickly. (Sorry, \n\nagain Stater Brothers, but since you remodeled, I cannot find \n\nanything.)\n\n5. Limited selection. (Sorry, Trader Joe\u2019s, I\u2019m not coming for \n\none clever thing at a great price.)\n\n6. Won\u2019t take credit cards.\n\n7. Demand a special club card. That makes it more trouble than \n\nit\u2019s worth.\n\n8. Parking hassles.\n\n9. Obnoxious other customers.

Here are \n\nthe rejection factors I perceive.\n\n1. Risk of roll over. They might start making them safer.\n\n2. The alternative is still affordable. I don\u2019t have one car \n\nthat will do everything an SUV will do, but I can still \n\nafford other cars: a sports car, a truck, a luxury sedan, \n\nthat can do everything an SUV can do, only better. When the \n\nproblems with maintaining so many cars becomes too great, \n\nthen an SUV might look better. \n\nTIME SHARE: I have been to a couple of their obnoxious presentations and \n\nthat was enough to convince me that they were not a good investment.\n\n1. Most firms in the business seem disreputable. If the deal is \n\nso good for the customer, why do they want to force you to \n\nsign now? Maybe because the more you think about it, the \n\nmore obvious are the unfavorables.\n\n2. The alternatives look better. Hotels turn out to be a lot \n\ncheaper and give more flexibility. Buying a vacation home \n\nis a better investment. Owning a time share gives you the \n\nfinancial responsibilities of a home, with the time limited \n\nprivate space of a hotel room. \n\nVIDEO RENTALS: I used to rent two or three videos a week. I have \n\nnot for several years. It was not the high price or the limited \n\nselection. There was one other problem that killed the deal: the \n\nhassle of making a special trip to return the rented video. Netflix \n\nsolved that problem and had me until they became too confusing.\n\nWRIST WATCH: I do need to tell time, but I have a Rolex at home I \n\nnever wear (and wish I had never purchased it).\n\n1. Fear of breaking it. \n\n2. Fear of losing it.\n\n3. Fear of getting it stolen. I am even afraid that the Rolex \n\nwill attract a robber who would otherwise have left me \n\nalone.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n37 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\n4. Fear of getting it wet. \n\n5. Wrong style for my clothes.\n\n6. Can\u2019t see the time. The hands and numbers are hard to see. \n\n7. Doesn\u2019t have the features I want (alarm, etc.).\n\nSo, it stays home in a safe place, and I am not going to purchase \n\nanother. \n\nDecision making is not an event, with a beginning and a conclusion, but an ongoing process. It never \nreally ends. It achieves some working points that serve as the foundation for action, but it is never really \nover. According to Payne, Bettman, and Johnson, authors of The Adaptive Decision Maker, people are \nconstantly modifying their criteria in light of past decisions and present realities. \n\nThe process continues not just because new facts and alternatives present themselves, but because the \npriorities of consumers keep shifting. Remember that Mazda Miata you bought when you were 18? Now \nyou are buying a minivan. The facts about the Miata and the Minivan have not changed, but after two \nkids, your priorities sure have, and that means that your perceptions of problems have changed. The \nMazda two seater may be big enough for thy wife and thee, but baby makes three.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/GTca\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n38 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nIf you have a business and wonder why your product \u201clost\u201d the competition, well, it never really lost, it \nwas just eliminated from the contest because of the rejection factors. It got disqualified by the potential \ncustomers\u2019 rules. The good news is that there is usually another contest tomorrow, perhaps with the same \ncustomer and his revised unfavorables list, or with a new generation of customers with different priorities. \nApple Computer lost out in the home computer segment, but came back with new products (e.g., pod, \nphone, pad). Its computers started looking better when they started using Intel Chips that could run \nWindows. Even Bank of America, and America Online, rejected by millions of former customers, have \nnot completely lost. Some of their former customers may comeback and give the redefined company \nanother look (but of course some stalwarts of bad customer service will probably go broke before enough \nof the former customers come back.)\n\nPerhaps you think that consumers are foolish for being guided by the unfavorables, even to the point of \nbecoming excessively fearful or risk averse. Your task in developing a product is not to criticize consumer \nthinking, but to understand it and use it.\n\nThe rejection mindset of consumers has been attributed to various factors. Psychologist Julie K. Norem \nin The Positive Power of Negative Thinking looked at pessimism, obsessive worry, lowered expectations, \neven the prevalence of the Murphy\u2019s Law delusion as psychological defense mechanisms.\n\nClearly, people are risk averse, and many risks are given exaggerated importance. People are concerned \nabout the dangers of airline crashes, yet per passenger mile it remains one of the safest modes of \ntransportation around. Indeed, most people have a greater risk of fatal accident driving to and from \nthe airport than they do flying to their destination. It has even been estimated that when the terrorists \nfrightened potential travelers in the wake of 9-11, another three thousand people died on the nation\u2019s \nhighways trying to avoid the \u201crisky\u201d skies. \n\nMillions of people have made other kinds of life changing decisions based upon perceived terrorist \nthreats, even though those risks are fairly confined geographically: just two percent of the nation\u2019s zip \ncodes face more than 90% of the risk from terrorist attacks.\n\nDramatic risks are exaggerated, as in the case of parents who fear that children will find guns and start \nplaying with them. More children are killed each year when left unattended with swimming pools than \nwith guns.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n39 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nOverall, however, using perceptions of the unfavorables to satisfice is quite consistent with mental health. \nBarry Schwartz in The Paradox of Choice: why more is less noted that the alternative to satisficing is to \nconstantly attempt to maximize, and be unsatisfied with any product or service that is not perfect on all \naccounts. This leads to dissatisfaction. \u201cThe drawbacks of maximizing are so profound, and the benefits \nso tenuous that we may well ask why anyone would pursue such a strategy.\u201d To be less depressed, embrace \nsatisficing.\n\nAnother distorted perception on present choices would be the past. Those things carrying the most \nweight are not part experiences, but previous decisions. It is the latter, more so than the former, that \nframe the present decisions with excess baggage. People do not want to admit that they were wrong in \nthe past, and therefore tend to perpetuate previous decisions, wise or not. People might follow a losing \nstock until the company is bankrupt because they don\u2019t want to admit that they were wrong not to sell \npreviously (or admit that they were wrong to buy it in the first place).\n\nThe process of decision making never ends, but people do get tired of the process and want to call a \ntemporary halt. When the customer says that he needs to think it over, he just needs some time to stop \nthinking. He has pretty much excluded your product, or at least finds that its further consideration is \nbothersome. You could ask him just what is it that he needs to think over, but that would presume that \nhe is going to use the near future to gather relevant information (which he is not). In certain contexts \n\u201cI\u2019ll wait\u201d or \u201cLet me think about it\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll be back\u201d is but a social courtesy, a euphemism for \u201cNo, \nand I don\u2019t want to stay here and argue about it.\u201d In other contexts, the customer leaves with a sincere \nintention to give the product further consideration, but a failure of memory or other unforeseen future \nfactors prevent the purchase.\n\nSuccessful selling is leading the customers to where they want to go, to the solution of problems, not \nmanipulating them out of their hard-earned money. The best sales \u201cpitch\u201d should be a series of pain \navoiding steps.\n\nConsumers can and do make their choices freely, even if sales people are not happy with those choices. \nSome salespeople even deny the philosophical concept of free will, and proceed (or prefer to proceed) \nas if determinism ruled the day. Determinism is the assumption that people don\u2019t (because they can\u2019t) \nmake up their minds. People have no more \u201cchoice\u201d in their selections and decisions than billiard balls \nthat bounce away from the forces that strike them. Man is internally programmed by his DNA (according \nto the sociobiologists) or maybe it\u2019s his unconscious (according to the psychoanalysts) or maybe it\u2019s just \nthe externals of stimulus and response (according to the behaviorists). According to these determinists, \npeople cannot resist the power of these influencers. Once we know a person\u2019s DNA or the cumulative \nweight of the stimuli acting upon him, we can predict the responses in his life: which woman he will \npropose to, which product he will purchase.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n40 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nI reject determinism and advocate a doctrine of free will, and wise marketers will do the same. I accept \nthe conclusion of N. Alden Stevens \u201cWill is making a choice.\u201d Perhaps there is no way to know for certain \nthat the process of making a choice is a reality, but here is what we know for sure, people are convinced \nthat they are participating in the process, and we stand a better chance of influencing that process if we \nshare the conviction (albeit a delusion) that the process is free and indeterminate. As Stevens goes on \nto say \u201cMaking a choice is active, which means that will consumes energy.\u201d People don\u2019t come to a final \nconclusion allowing the process to cease; they sometimes run out of energy and the process slows down, \nand the attention gets diverted to something else.\n\nOne way that the process slows or narrows is the rejection of certain alternatives. How many points \ndoes a potential consumer need to reject an alternative? Just one: the fatal flaw, the weakest link, the \nAchilles heel. \n\n\u201cThere are no cattle without a dung heap.\u201d \n\u2013 Chuana Proverb\n\nOnce that fatal flaw is visualized, the mind goes on to something else. These fatal flaws are the deal \nbreakers. Once they are perceived, the alternative is rejected, according to Stephen A. Giglio, author of \nBeating the Deal Killers: overcoming Murphy\u2019s law (and other sales nightmares).\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n                . \n\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/AlcatelLucent\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n41 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nThe way to conceptualize every alternative chosen by a consumer is to view it as an attempt to avoid \nsomething else that had higher unfavorables.\n\nWhy do people pay so much to rent a tuxedo for a wedding? (because buying a new one would have \nbeen more expensive, and then it would be hanging in the closet for all those years). Why do people \nshell out a hundred dollars to stay in a local hotel? (because staying in the paneled den at Uncle Bill\u2019s \nand Aunt Sue\u2019s is even less tolerable).\n\nTo sell your product, convince the consumer that the unfavorables of the competition (including those \nof doing it himself) are greater than the unfavorables of your product.\n\nA related aspect of \u201csatisficing\u201d concerns when people stop their search. Consumers stop their search \nfor an acceptable product or service, not when they find the perfect one (or they would still be looking), \nbut when they are tired enough to settle for an acceptable one. \n\nConsider a couple traveling by car on their way from Texas to California. They are just getting into \nTucson on the I-10. They might pass the first couple of motels they see after nightfall: too early yet, \nthat one is not close to a restaurant, that one is probably too expensive. Indeed, they will never find the \nperfect motel, but as they get more tired, the bases for rejection become less compelling. Eventually, \nthey will stop and select one, with full knowledge that they can go a little further down the road and \nfind one that is at least as good, perhaps a little better. The point is, they are simply tired of the search, \nand this alternative they have before them now is \u201cgood enough.\u201d The selection is merely satisfactory, \nnot optimal, but that is where the process stops for now.\n\nThis is how most people select a job. They spend several weeks looking at the want ads, and hopefully get \na few interviews. Maybe these highly confident job applicants turned down a few offers, citing the obvious \nunfavorables: this one had a bad commute, that one had few fringe benefits, that one had no prospects \nfor future advancement. There is a name for people who persist in this type of job search: unemployed. \nEventually, most people tire of the search (rather than find a perfect job) and end up satisficing with a \nless than perfect job that is \u201cgood enough for now.\u201d\n\nSatisficing is how much people find their first home to purchase. They spend weeks or months looking \nat the real estate ads, going to open houses, touring sites with a real estate agent. The savvy agent \nunderstands how people think by rejection, and the first few properties she shows her clients may be \ndesigned to bring out the hidden concerns. \u201cOh, so you rejected this house because it was on a corner \nlot? Memo to self: don\u2019t show this couple any more corner lots.\u201d Eventually the couple is convinced that \nit is not possible to get their dream home right now, but they are willing to purchase a starter home. It \nis a little further away than they had hoped, a little smaller, and a lot more expensive than what they \nwere planning on, but at least they can afford it. There is a special name for people who are so picky in \ntheir starter home that they continue the search indefinitely: they are called renters.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n42 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nSatisficing is how people select a spouse. Think of all the rejection factors to narrow down the field. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t date him: too old, too young, too fat, too bald, too big a nose, too short, no ambition, no \neducation, no money, ugly car, too much of a jerk, kids from previous relationship, doesn\u2019t like kids, \ndoesn\u2019t like dogs.\u201d Each woman sorts out dozens (perhaps thousands) of potential mates, managing to \nreject most of them on one or more grounds. Eventually, she hears the ticking of her biological clock, \nand gets a little less picky. We have a name for women who remain very picky: single. Of course, some \nwomen are insufficiently picky, and quickly marry a handsome jerk with a gambling or drinking problem, \nand we have a name for them as well: soon divorced.\n\nIn all of these examples, the tendency toward satisficing is inversely related to the perceived costs (of \nmoney, effort, delay, and mere attention) of continuing the search. The search ends only when the problems \nof continuing the search are seen as more daunting than those of a particular, available alternative.\n\nBut decision making is never really over, because life never ceases to present us with decisions to be \nmade. The same woman who is trying to decide about a mate, is also making decisions about which \napartment to rent, which job to take, which car to buy, which vet for her cat, where to spend next Easter. \nMaybe she is just plain tired of trying to make five big decisions at once.\n\nPeople who find it difficult or unpleasant to multi-task are more likely to satisfice so that they can declare \nin their own minds that at least one decision has been resolved, and they can then move on to the next one.\n\nThe satisficer may have a genuine socio-psychological profile, according to Barry Schwartz. Let us \nunderstand the decision maker in terms of a nexus of different social roles. Many social roles are like \nroads and guide us to consider certain alternatives or emphasize certain priorities. Other social roles \nare more like fences, and prevent us from considering certain products.\n\nIn trying to outline the sequence of consumer consideration of a given product, over a quarter of a \ncentury ago, James Bettman wrote An Information Processing Theory of Consumer Choice. He envisioned \na woman shopping for a dress, and outlined a series of yes\/no questions (with just one wrong answer \nleading to the rejection of a given dress).\n\n\u2022\t Do I need this type of item?\n\u2022\t Do I already have one like it?\n\u2022\t Is it comfortable?\n\u2022\t Is it easy to care for?\n\u2022\t Could I make it myself?\n\u2022\t Is it well made?\n\u2022\t Could I wear it many times?\n\u2022\t Is my size available?\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n43 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\n\u2022\t Is it affordable?\n\u2022\t Does it fit me at my\u2026?\n\u2022\t Do I like the fabric?\n\u2022\t Is it too risque?\n\u2022\t Is it too dowdy?\n\u2022\t Do I like this color?\n\u2022\t Do I like the way it looks?\n\u2022\t Do I like the brand?\n\u2022\t Do I like it better than other dresses I could buy heretoday?\n\u2022\t Would I prefer to buy it here rather than some other store?\n\u2022\t Would I prefer to wait and buy it later?\n\u2022\t Should I buy it here today in the store or order from a catalogue, phone, or online?\n\u2022\t Will they take my credit card or check?\n\nIn terms of modifying the product to do better in the marketplace, too many firms try to add a new \nfeature, and irrelevant bell or whistle or glitzy new packaging. Most firms would be better off getting rid \nof an old problem rather than adding a new feature. This would remove many barriers to old customers \nwho tried and left the product and also to potential customers who previously rejected the product \nbefore they even tried it.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\nwww.mastersopenday.nl\n\nVisit us and find out why we are the best!\nMaster\u2019s Open Day: 22 February 2014\n\nJoin the best at\nthe Maastricht University\nSchool of Business and\nEconomics!\n\nTop master\u2019s programmes\n\u2022\t \t33rd\tplace\tFinancial\tTimes\tworldwide\tranking:\tMSc\t\nInternational\tBusiness\n\n\u2022\t 1st\tplace:\tMSc\tInternational\tBusiness\n\u2022\t 1st\tplace:\tMSc\tFinancial\tEconomics\n\u2022\t 2nd\tplace:\tMSc\tManagement\tof\tLearning\n\u2022\t 2nd\tplace:\tMSc\tEconomics\n\u2022\t \t2nd\tplace:\tMSc\tEconometrics\tand\tOperations\tResearch\n\u2022\t \t2nd\tplace:\tMSc\tGlobal\tSupply\tChain\tManagement\tand\t\nChange\n\nSources: Keuzegids Master ranking 2013; Elsevier \u2018Beste Studies\u2019 ranking 2012; \nFinancial Times Global Masters in Management ranking 2012\n\nMaastricht\nUniversity is\n\nthe best specialist\nuniversity in the\n\nNetherlands\n(Elsevier)\n\nhttp:\/\/www.mastersopenday.nl\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n44 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nThe time allotted to consumers\u2019 decision making is not infinite. Human decision makers are rarely like \nthe fictional donkey, Buridan\u2019s ass (the hungry donkey placed between two equally attractive buckets of \noats, starved because he could not make up his mind which to eat first). People (and animals) get bored \nwith the decision making process and start eating from whichever (or both piles). Satisficing hunger is \nmore important and more immediate than selecting the better of the two piles. \n\nOne big factor for most products is where to put it after it has been purchased. Sellers rarely address \nthis concern, but difficulty of storage is a major criterion in any realistic, adult purchase decision. On \nany Saturday, drive around most suburban areas and what do you see: garage sales. The things being \nsold there are rarely without favorable attributes. The knickknacks are cute. The sports equipment still \nworks. These sales are not motivated primarily by hopes of riches. Products are traded for pennies on \nthe dollar. The biggest offense of the merchandise to be sold is that it was taking up space. Indeed, some \nof these suburbanites bought a home, and then bought a larger home, primarily to have the space to put \ntheir accumulation of junk. Household junk expands to fill the space allotted to it. Buy a bigger house, \nand the junk will come, and stay. Just listen to the conversations of the customers who have stopped to \nlook. The wife says \u201cHow cute for the kitchen\u201d but then her husband says \u201cBut where will you put it?\u201d \nHe says \u201cI always wanted to get this type of equipment\u201d but then his wife says \u201cIs there room in the \ngarage\u201d? and he puts it back.\n\nOne way to conceptualize this type of thinking would be the quest for the fatal flaw, the weakest link. \n\n\u201cThe weakest link, not the strongest, determines how much security you have.\u201d \n\u2013 Howard Strauss\n\nAnother reason for rejecting a specific product may be the lack of the availability of complementary \nproducts. Imagine going to the store to get products of a picnic. You notice that the store is sold out of \nhot dog buns, so you forget about buying hotdogs and mustard. You cannot find little plastic cups, so \nyou don\u2019t get soda in two liter bottles, but opt for the smaller cans. \n\nOne selling strategy is to directly confront the unfavorables. This works best when the objections are \n1. few; 2. identifiable; 3. easy to pre-empt.\n\nFor decades, Bank of America has offered the worst customer service in the industry. Why does anyone \nstill bank there? For some bank customers, the biggest concern is ATM availability. The unfavorable \nthat these customers wish to avoid are having to drive out of their way to find an ATM machine (or pay \nextra for the service of getting cash). These customers satisfice and put up with poor customer service \nand fees in order to avoid those problems, so they stay with B of A.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n45 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nFor the first decade of the internet, American OnLine (AOL) provided horrible customer service. Indeed, \nmost of us early cybernauts started out on the internet as AOL customers, and then grew frustrated with \nhigh bills and poor service, and found another local provider of dial up (or eventually a broad band \nconnection). AOL was not the first great dial up provider, Prodigy had that honor. Indeed, Prodigy worked \na lot harder to provide the backbone for a more reliable connection. What allowed AOL membership to \nsurge was that it solved the biggest problem that new users faced \u201cHow do I get started?\u201d AOL sent out \nthese simple disks: insert and follow the directions. AOL recognized that critical problem, met it, and \ngrew. As the key factors changed to reliability, speed, and price, AOL lost. \n\nOf course the amazing thing with AOL is how they kept so many customers for so long. I have asked \nseveral of my colleagues and students why such sophisticated people are with such a poor quality provider. \nOne answer I consistently have received is that the hassle of conversion (especially of getting a new email \naddress) is perceived as the deal breaker with a new provider (and therefore the life preserver for AOL).\n\nAnother example of a high priced, low quality marketing success would be the Apollo Corporation, \nwhich does business as the University of Phoenix. Why would anyone spend money and time for a degree \nrecognized as not much better than a diploma mill? One factor is that the greatest stumbling block (i.e., \ntuition costs) can be shifted onto a third party (e.g., the federal government, employee reimbursement). \nAnother factor is that, from the potential students\u2019 perspective, the greatest cost to an education is not \nmoney, but time, and Phoenix makes that seem easy: one night a week or online. \n\nOne of the most successful used car dealers in the San Francisco Bay region was Joe Putnam of Putnam \nBuick in Burlingame. His location was OK, but not the best. His cars were not the most popular make. \nHis prices were OK, but not the lowest. What made Joe Putnam\u2019s sales force so successful is that they \nhad figured out the pattern of rejections, the specific objections that potential customers would raise. \nOver the years, Putnam saw hundreds of deals lost when customers who had shown some initial interest \nin the car said, \u201cI cannot make a deal today, because I shall have to trade in my old car as part of the \ndeal, and I did not bring my pink slip.\u201d Other paralyzing excuses concerned the lack of a checkbook or \na spouse\u2019s permission. In his radio ads, Putnam preempted these factors when he said, \u201cBring your wife, \nyour pink slip, and your checkbook.\u201d Then salesmen would routinely ask for these things before they \nwent out on a test drive, and found that they were less likely to invest their valuable time with buyers \nwho were unprepared to consummate the deal.\n\nWhen selling a large household item, such as a mattress, a garage door, or major piece of furniture or \nappliance, a savvy potential customer is thinking of two great excuses for not buying a new one: delivery \ncosts and how do we get rid of the old one? Build into your advertisement: free delivery and removal \nof your old model and most customers will yell \u201cdeal\u201d before they have begun to calculate the costs of \ndoing things themselves. They are tired of the search for the mattress, and don\u2019t want to go on a new \nsearch for the cheapest delivery and the cheapest removal of the old mattress.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n46 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nToo many marketers are their own worst enemy, introducing yet another factor serving as a deal breaker \n(or at least some stipulation that will be perceived as such).\n\nWhy did I stop buying my tortillas at the corner stand? Quality and value wise, I could not see the \ndifference between them and the other stand a half block further. But one morning, when it was just me \naround the house, and I didn\u2019t want a kilo or even half kilo, I just wanted three pesos worth of tortillas, \nthe order taker said \u201cNo orders smaller than five pesos.\u201d I didn\u2019t want that many. I couldn\u2019t eat that many \nall by myself, and I hate to put them in the refrigerator. The other stand saw no problem, and I think \nthat they even put a few extra on my three peso stack that morning. Now, I always go to the other place, \neven when I have a large party and need two kilos.\n\nAnother good example about how some colleges and universities (especially non-profit and public) \ndeter customers is by making the process of registration so difficult. Some community colleges require \nprospective students to come on campus, during the day, stand in lines, and discover that the desired \ncourses were closed, when all the student wanted was evening or online courses. If there is one thing \nthat University of Phoenix does right, it makes it very easy for students to get registered and pay for \ntheir classes.\n\nOvercoming the rejection factors begins with advertising that pre-empts these unfavorables. Consider \nthe (unconscious) mental justification that the potential consumer is using to tune out your message.\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read moreClick on the ad to read more\n\nhttp:\/\/s.bookboon.com\/BI\n\n\nBuzz or Zap?\n\n47 \n\nHow Consumers Make Decisions\n\nPERCEPTION: I don\u2019t have the time or energy to absorb your ad, so I am going to zap it: tune it out, flip \npast it, punch the button, channel surf, delete, filter out, turn down the volume, or go to the bathroom.\n\nSOLUTION: Radio and TV stations in particular need to avoid long commercial blocks, and do not put \nthe most boring or objectionable first, because it hurts all those coming afterward.\n\nPERCEPTION: I don\u2019t need it.\n\nSOLUTION: Focus on risk, health, comfort, convenience, fun, status, financial gain, altruism and guilt.\n\nPERCEPTION: It\u2019s just too complicated.\n\nSOLUTION: Focus on ease of use, timid old ladies and little children using the product without difficulty.\n\nPERCEPTION: I could not afford it.\n\nSOLUTION: Focus on financing or compared to some alternative.\n\nPERCEPTION: The upkeep is a hassle: storing, cleaning, maintenance, carrying, recharging, etc.\n\nSOLUTION: Demonstrate ease.\n\nPERCEPTION: It will be hard to get rid of.\n\nSOLUTION: Demonstrate ease of disposal. \n\nPERCEPTION: It probably doesn\u2019t work.

This weapon was such a technological advance, and would be so decisive in combat \nthat their greatest fear was that information about it would fall into German hands, so they kept the \nprototypes locked up. When the war broke out and the machine guns were sent to the front, the French \nsoldiers were so unfamiliar with it that they were not able to use it properly. \n\nThe conjunctive process of multiple criteria is set in motion by the conscious recognition of a need and \nimplementation of an active search strategy. Sometimes there is no active search by the recognition of a \nneed, but merely the presentation of an attractive alternative, which awakens a need that has heretofore \nnot been acknowledged (e.g., religious conversion, love at first sight).\n\nConsumers rarely use precise algorithms, only vague heuristics. \u201cJust say no\u201d is the basic strategy, and it \nworks well. Remember, you are not guiding a customer decision getting to \u201cyes,\u201d but preventing a \u201cno.\u201d\n\nGreat salesmanship can overcome some of the objections, but not all. Consider this shoe salesman.\n\n\u201cBut the shoes are not in stock.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, they are so popular, they sell out quickly.

Relationship Course and Program Intended Learning Outcomes \n\nThis course fosters the objectives of the \u201cMarketing\u201d program that ensure students to have a \n\nsufficient level of knowledge of elements of sociology and consumer behavior.  \n\nIn particular, it addresses the following Program Intended Learning Outcomes: \n\n9. Interpret, select and apply marketing qualitative and quantitative research methods and tools \n\nsuch as focus groups, surveys, panel research, face-to-face interviews; \n\n10. Describe and apply the basic theories and instruments informing consumer decision-making \n\nprocesses, market segmentation and merchandising;  \n\n14. Apply basic research skills, critical thinking, information technologies and communication \n\nskills to select suitable theories and methodologies, retrieve relevant and accurate \n\ninformation, analyze data and elaborate conclusions in theoretical studies or applied \n\nprojects. \n\n2. Course Description \n\nAll people and organizations are purchasers and consumers of various products and services. A \n\nqualified marketing specialist must understand consumers to help them to make right choices. \n\nThis course is designed to introduce students to the changing aspects of consumer choices and \n\nbehavior. Consumer behavior is related to actions in which people are involved while searching \n\nfor, assessing, buying and consuming products and services they need. Their motivations and \n\ndecisions are based on such aspects as psychological traits, culture and life styles, brand \n\nrecognition and experience, level of education, and income.   \n\nThis course is intended to help the students to comprehend important concepts of consumer \n\nbehavior and to apply knowledge taught from the other courses (economic theory, sociology, \n\nmanagement, and marketing) to be able to do some preliminary research in consumer behavior. \n\nThis means that the students should be able to select an interesting consumer behavior problem, \n\nunderstand it using previous theoretical knowledge, relate the problem to the insights of the \n\nconsumer behavior taking into account the current market situation, make one or few creative \n\npredictions on solving or developing the problem and to deliver a group presentation at the end \n\nof the course. \n\n3. Course Learning Objectives \n\nThis course aims to: \n\n- ensure the students understand the importance of consumer behavior in the overall \n\nmarketing process  \n\n- provide an understanding of the aspects that compile and affect consumer behavior \n\n- give the students basic ideas and tools for analyzing consumer behavior \n\n- acquaint the students with most effective communication strategies towards consumers. \n\n4. Course Intended Learning Outcomes \n\nAt the successful completion of this course, students are expected to be able to: \n\nTheoretical and Practical Knowledge \n\n\n\n1. describe and explain consumer motivations, perceptions and decision making processes \n\nto include psychological and financial bases of consumer behavior in purchasing, \n\nconsuming and disposing products and services; \n\n2. enlist cultural differences and consumer diversity, divide population according to \n\ndemographics and lifestyles of people and explain how they can affect marketing\/selling \n\nactivities of companies; \n\n3. provide a basic analysis of consumer decision-making process and influence on it by \n\nwritten and\/or oral messages in various types of media; \n\n4. clarify how consumption habits change with the time and how companies act to appeal \n\nto consumers to behave \u201cgreen\u201d; \n\n \n\nCognitive and Practical Skills and Competences  \n\n \n\n5. combine knowledge deriving from previous courses (management, marketing, \n\nmicroeconomics\u2026) to the tasks required by consumer behavior; \n\n6. collect and present information about one specific issue for a group project; \n\n7. show the ethical issues related to the purchasing\/consumption activities of \n\npeople\/businesses; \n\n8. apply their acquired knowledge to different consumers\u2019 life situations in a proper \n\nprofessional manner. \n\n \n\n5. Teaching and Learning Philosophy \n\nAll people are buyers and consumers of goods and services. Studying consumer behavior means \n\nunderstanding own perceptions and actions, first of all. Those who are involved in marketing \n\nactivities should regard all these from the professional point of view. My role as a teacher is to \n\nmake students be able to understand their own motivation and behavior as buyers and \n\nconsumers to recognize and deal correctly with their customers\u2019 decisions in their professional \n\nlife later.   \n\nThe course consists of a mixture of lectures, written and on-site assignments and a project on \n\nstudying consumer behavior. I see my role in teaching not only as a \u201cknowledge giver\u201d but \n\nbasically as a facilitator of the students\u2019 \u201ctreasures mining and investigating process\u201d. That is \n\nwhy during the course students will be encouraged to read a lot, complete assignments that \n\nwould help them \u201ctaste\u201d the real marketing problems, and share their own ideas and thoughts \n\non consumers\u2019 actions and behavior with their peers.  \n\nHaving a high level of personal responsibility in life I would like my students to express the \n\nsimilar responsibility treating the course in a professional manner working individually and in \n\ngroups and showing highest ethical norms when they complete assignments or communicate \n\nwith teachers and students in real or virtual spaces. \n\n6. Course Policy \n\nClass Ethics \n\nA critical part of the course success depends on a student\u2019s attitude to the course and to those \n\nwho are involved in it \u2013 the teacher, the peer students and you. While studying the Business \n\nCommunication course the students are supposed to: \n\n\n\n- attend the classes on the regular bases, WITHOUT any delay (those who arrive later are \n\nnot allowed to enter the class). If a student misses more than five hours, there will be \n\nZERO GRADE for the course; \n\n- be prepared to EACH session which means to read ALL the required material BEFORE \n\nthe class and to be ready to contribute to the class discussions and show your \n\npreparation by asking questions whenever necessary; \n\n- be expected to ENGAGE in class discussions. Failure to do so may impact the grade; \n\n- deliver all the assignments ON TIME; delivering assignments later insures reduction of \n\nthe grade; \n\n- not use any electronic device until it required by the educational process and allowed by \n\nthe teacher, and switch all the electronic devices on the \u201cmute\u201d mode during the class \n\ntime; \n\n- behave as they would be doing their businesses; businesslike behavior is one of the \n\nindicators of the skills that students would grasp during the course. \n\nIf a student misses classes due to illness it will be his\/her responsibility to recover the taught \n\nmaterial. \n\nExams Ethics  \n\nFor the exam it is not allowed to: \n\n- arrive late; \n\n- use any electronic device during the exam time; \n\n- use any book or notes until it is an open book exam; \n\n- cheat. A student who has been caught on cheating should leave the room immediately, \n\nand s\/he obtains zero grade. \n\nIf a student misses the midterms or exam because of serious reasons s\/he should obtain \n\npermission from the Dean and complete these during the additional time assigned by the \n\nteacher. \n\nAlmaty Management University is committed to the principle of academic honesty and integrity \n\nthat are highest values in the educational process. In general, the policy of academic conduct \n\nand ethics is based on the Code of Corporate Culture, the Student Code of Ethics and the \n\nInternal Regulations of AlmaU. \n\nInformation and Communications \n\nStudents enrolled for the course should check the Platonus system and the group email on the \n\nregular basis, which means development of good communication between the teacher and the \n\nstudents and acquiring right business habits. Please respect your time and one of the teacher: if \n\nassignments and messages are sent late in the day they will be checked next day. \n\n7. Course Learning Activities \n\nTotal Hours 125 \n\nDistribution: \n\n- Class Contact. Students are expected to attend classes and to actively participate in \n\ndiscussions (45 hours)  \n\n\n\n- Reading. Students should read the required texts and materials for each class (30 hours)  \n\n- Written assignment.  This is the first assignment that is completed according to the set \n\nquestions and requires from students to express their own thoughts about consumer \n\nbehavior (2 hours) \n\n- Practical assignments. These assignments are related to real life situations and require \n\nstudent skills of working with the Internet. I leave these assignments to be given and \n\nconducted\/assessed by the visiting professors  (3+3 hours) \n\n- Case study. There will be two cases during the course. One as a regular task and another as a \n\nmidterm task. Students are required to read them and draw analyses according to the \n\nquestions prepared by the teacher (3+3 hours) \n\n- Practical on-site assignments. Students are to complete the assignments that require them \n\nto go to the real store and later deliver the written analysis on what they have learned there \n\n(4+4 hours) \n\n- Midterm preparation. Students are to refresh all the topics that had been studied during the \n\nperiod that preceded the midterm (8+8 hours)  \n\n- Presentation-1 preparation. Students should develop the outlines of the chosen topic and \n\npresent it to the teacher (5 hours)  \n\n- Exam preparation. Preparation to the exam means that students should revise and finalize \n\ntheir PowerPoint presentation and rehearse their oral speeches (5 hours)  \n\n- Exam. During the exam time students make their group presentations before the class as a \n\nfinal activity for the course (2 hours)  \n\n8. Course Assessment and Grading \n\nAssessment Structure \n\nAssessment 1 (30%) \n\n- Assessment Activity A (5%). Written assignment about students\u2019 attitude to purchasing \n\ngoods\/services is completed in accordance with the set questions.  \n\n- Assessment Activity B (8%). Practical On-site Assignment is related to the consumer \n\nresearch. According to the studied topic students have to go to the store and observe people \n\nbuying manufacturing products\/services. This assignment is to give students understanding \n\non consumer motivation. Later the students analyze what they\u2019ve seen and deliver the \n\nreport. Another part of the assignment is presentation of the project\u2019s idea draft. It is chosen \n\nfrom the list of suggested topics\/aspects of the consumer behavior prepared by the teacher. \n\nAs this is a group task the students should work together. \n\n- Assessment Activity C (7%). Case study and follow-up practical assignment on knowing \n\nattitudes, values and perceptions of the students as consumers. This assignment is related \n\nto working with the web. \n\n- Assessment Activity D (10%). Midterm #1 consists of the open questions and tests covering \n\nall the topics studied prior the midterm week. \n\nAssessment 2 (30%) \n\n- Assessment Activity A (10%). Practical assignment is related to gathering real data about \n\ndemographics, consumer diversity, values and lifestyles of Kazakhstani people. Students are \n\nexpected to study marketing data and materials on the topic from different research \n\nagencies. Second part of the assignment is presentation of the group project. The expected \n\n\n\noutcome is that students are able to relate their chosen idea to the topics already taught in \n\nthe course. \n\n- Assessment Activity B (10%). Practical On-site Assignment is related to the consumer \n\nresearch. According to the studied topic students have to go to the food store and observe \n\npeople buying food products. This assignment will help students understand buying \n\nbehavior based on people income. Later the students analyze what they\u2019ve seen and deliver \n\nthe report. \n\n- Assessment Activity C (10%). Midterm #2 is based on the case study. The students are to \n\nread the case and answer the questions set by the teacher. The midterm also contains \n\nmultiple questions related to the studied topics during the second part of the course. \n\nFinal Assessment (40%) \n\n- Assessment Activity A (40%). The final exam for this course consists of the group projects\u2019 \n\nfinal presentations. During the presentation all group members should speak up.

Relationship Course and Program Intended Learning Outcomes \n\nThis course fosters the objectives of the Management program. In particular, it addresses the \n\nfollowing Program Intended Learning Outcomes: \n\n2. Read, write and present academic and basic texts in the main language of the program; \n\n13. Perform basic critical analysis, provide and support personal views, and work on projects in \n\ncooperation with others; \n\n14. Apply basic research skills, critical thinking, information technologies and communication \n\nskills to select suitable theories and methodologies, retrieve relevant and accurate \n\ninformation, analyze data and elaborate conclusions in theoretical studies or applied \n\nprojects. \n\n2. Course Description \n\nBusiness heavily depends on communication: companies coordinate manufacturing and delivery \nprocesses, they persuade customers to buy products by placing advertisements in various media. \nIn the modern world employers consider communication as one of the most critical skills for \nworkers today. Communication \u2013 verbal and nonverbal \u2013 takes many forms: from writing a non-\npersonal text to face-to-face conversation, from informal chats to formal documents or minutes \nof business meetings. Future specialists in management should be able to deal with a wide range \nof general problems of communication in a modern society. \nThe purpose of the \u201cBusiness Communication\u201d course is to prepare the students for \ncommunications in business, either it could be private, public, or nonprofit company. An \nimportant aspect of the course will be cultural and ethical considerations of a company\u2019s \ninteraction with other businesses and employees. \nStudents should acquire knowledge in the field of business communication that would be \nnecessary for them not only during the study period, but also in their future independent \nprofessional activity. At the end of the course students will know how to organize business \nmemos, emails and letters, as well as they will compose a resume and a cover letter prepared for \na mock employment interview with a \u201cprospective employer\u201d. \n \n3. Course Learning Objectives \n\nThis course aims to: \n\n- provide an understanding of the basics of communication theory and the psychology of \n\nbusiness communication; \n\n- ensure the students as future specialist understand a wide range of general problems of \n\ncommunication in the modern society; \n\n- acquaint the students with the main information channels and their role in business, the \n\nuse of modern technologies in business communication, define factors that affect the \n\nprocess of interaction with various groups of the public and recognize the problems of \n\norganizing and conducting special events; \n\n- give the students some ideas how to cooperate effectively with others (students, faculty \n\nmembers, university staff, internship institutions, business partners and civil society) for \n\nfostering knowledge and working on assignments together; \n\n- provide the students with strategies and techniques of oral presentation. \n\n \n\n\n\n4. Course Intended Learning Outcomes \n\nAt the successful completion of this course, students are expected to be able to: \n\nTheoretical and Practical Knowledge \n\n1. clarify how culture affects communication and describe methods to improve \n\nintercultural communication; \n\n2. explain why business letters are important in delivering messages outside an \n\norganization and enlist types of communication and specific techniques used in \n\norganizations; \n\n3. clarify how to organize e-mail messages and memos, support sentences, good\/bad news \n\nto customers and messages that express thanks, recognition, and sympathy using \n\nappropriate formats, a conversational tone and positive, courteous language and when to \n\nsend them; \n\n4. describe and explain techniques for becoming an effective listener; \n\n \n\nCognitive and Practical Skills and Competences  \n\n \n\n5. provide a basic analysis of written and\/or oral messages in various types of media; \n\n6. distinguish between ethical and unethical professional behavior and business etiquette \n\nidentifying smart communication practices, including content, tone, correctness, and \n\nnetiquette;  \n\n7. specify delivery techniques used before, during, and after a presentation; \n\n8. clarify how to use different negotiation strategies and tactics and identify how to prepare \n\na r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and an e-portfolio for a successful job interview and to write follow-up letters. \n\n5. Teaching and Learning Philosophy \n\nIn the business world one of the key to success is a person\u2019s ability to communicate. Studying \n\nthe Business Communication course will give students the keys to excellent communication \n\nskills that can be later translated into success in their carriers. Modern businesses are interested \n\nin professionals that can handle any situation, either in office relations with colleagues or senior \n\nmanagers or in communication with clients\/customers that may bring complains or suggestions. \n\nThis kind of professional attitude can increase the effectiveness of a business and boost profits \n\nand improve a company\u2019s image in real-life settings.  My role as a teacher is to make students be \n\nable to understand their own motivation and behavior as communicators and acquire \n\ncommunication skills that are often ranked by employers among the most requested \n\ncompetencies.   \n\nThe course consists of a mixture of lectures, written and oral assignments and case studies that \n\nwould allow students to be closer to professional future. I see my role in teaching not only as a \n\n\u201cknowledge giver\u201d but basically as a facilitator of the students\u2019 \u201ctreasures mining and \n\ninvestigating process\u201d. That is why during the course students will be encouraged to read a lot, \n\ncomplete assignments that would help them \u201ctaste\u201d the real communication problems, and \n\nshare their own ideas and thoughts on the course topics.  \n\nHaving a high level of personal responsibility in life I would like my students to express the \n\nsimilar responsibility treating the course in a professional manner working individually and in \n\n\n\ngroups and showing highest ethical norms when they complete assignments or communicate \n\nwith teachers and students in real or virtual spaces. \n\n6. Course Policy \n\nClass Ethics \n\nA critical part of the course success depends on a student\u2019s attitude to the course and to those \n\nwho are involved in it \u2013 the teacher, the peer students and you. While studying the Business \n\nCommunication course the students are supposed to: \n\n- attend the classes on the regular bases, WITHOUT any delay (those who arrive later are \n\nnot allowed to enter the class). If a student misses more than five hours, there will be \n\nZERO GRADE for the course; \n\n- be prepared to EACH session which means to read ALL the required material BEFORE \n\nthe class and to be ready to contribute to the class discussions and show your \n\npreparation by asking questions whenever necessary; \n\n- be expected to ENGAGE in class discussions. Failure to do so may impact the grade; \n\n- deliver all the assignments ON TIME; delivering assignments later insures reduction of \n\nthe grade; \n\n- not use any electronic device until it required by the educational process and allowed by \n\nthe teacher, and switch all the electronic devices on the \u201cmute\u201d mode during the class \n\ntime; \n\n- behave as they would be doing their businesses; businesslike behavior is one of the \n\nindicators of the skills that students would grasp during the course. \n\nIf a student misses classes due to illness it will be his\/her responsibility to recover the taught \n\nmaterial. \n\nExams Ethics  \n\nFor the exam it is not allowed to: \n\n- arrive late; \n\n- use any electronic device during the exam time; \n\n- use any book or notes until it is an open book exam; \n\n- cheat. A student who has been caught on cheating should leave the room immediately, \n\nand s\/he obtains zero grade. \n\nIf a student misses the midterms or exam because of serious reasons s\/he should obtain \n\npermission from the Dean and complete these during the additional time assigned by the \n\nteacher. \n\nAlmaty Management University is committed to the principle of academic honesty and integrity \n\nthat are highest values in the educational process. In general, the policy of academic conduct \n\nand ethics is based on the Code of Corporate Culture, the Student Code of Ethics and the \n\nInternal Regulations of AlmaU. \n\nInformation and Communications \n\nStudents enrolled for the course should check the Platonus system and the group email on the \n\nregular basis, which means development of good communication between the teacher and the \n\n\n\nstudents and acquiring right business habits. Please respect your time and one of the teacher: if \n\nassignments and messages are sent late in the day they will be checked next day. \n\n7.

McCloskey, former State Department spokesman\n\nIntroductory Exercises\n\n1. Write five words that express what you want to do and where you want to be a year from now.\nTake those five words and write a paragraph that clearly articulates your responses to both \u201cwhat\u201d\nand \u201cwhere.\u201d\n\n2. Think of five words that express what you want to do and where you want to be five years from\nnow. Share your five words with your classmates and listen to their responses. What patterns do you\nobserve in the responses? Write a paragraph that addresses at least one observation.\n\nCommunication is an activity, skill, and art that incorporates lessons learned across a wide spectrum of human\nknowledge. Perhaps the most time-honored form of communication is storytelling. We\u2019ve told each other stories\nfor ages to help make sense of our world, anticipate the future, and certainly to entertain ourselves. The art of\nstorytelling draws on your understanding of yourself, your message, and how you communicate it to an audience\nthat is simultaneously communicating back to you. Your anticipation, reaction, and adaptation to the process will\ndetermine how successfully you are able to communicate. You were not born knowing how to write or even how\nto talk\u2014but in the process of growing up, you have undoubtedly learned how to tell, and how not tell, a story out\nloud and in writing.\n\nYou didn\u2019t learn to text in a day and didn\u2019t learn all the codes\u2014from LOL (laugh out loud) to BRB (be right\nback)\u2014right away. In the same way, learning to communicate well requires you to read and study how others\nhave expressed themselves, then adapt what you have learned to your present task\u2014whether it is texting a brief\nmessage to a friend, presenting your qualifications in a job interview, or writing a business report. You come to\nthis text with skills and an understanding that will provide a valuable foundation as we explore the communication\nprocess.\n\n1\n\n\n\nEffective communication takes preparation, practice, and persistence. There are many ways to learn\ncommunication skills; the school of experience, or \u201chard knocks,\u201d is one of them. But in the business environment,\na \u201cknock\u201d (or lesson learned) may come at the expense of your credibility through a blown presentation to a client.\nThe classroom environment, with a compilation of information and resources such as a text, can offer you a trial\nrun where you get to try out new ideas and skills before you have to use them to communicate effectively to make\na sale or form a new partnership. Listening to yourself, or perhaps the comments of others, may help you reflect\non new ways to present, or perceive, thoughts, ideas and concepts. The net result is your growth; ultimately your\nability to communicate in business will improve, opening more doors than you might anticipate.\n\nAs you learn the material in this text, each part will contribute to the whole. The degree to which you attend to\neach part will ultimately help give you the skills, confidence, and preparation to use communication in furthering\nyour career.\n\n2 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\n1.1 Why Is It Important to Communicate Well?\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n1. Recognize the importance of communication in gaining a better understanding of yourself and\nothers.\n\n2. Explain how communication skills help you solve problems, learn new things, and build your\ncareer.\n\nCommunication is key to your success\u2014in relationships, in the workplace, as a citizen of your country, and across\nyour lifetime. Your ability to communicate comes from experience, and experience can be an effective teacher,\nbut this text and the related business communication course will offer you a wealth of experiences gathered from\nprofessional speakers across their lifetimes. You can learn from the lessons they\u2019ve learned and be a more effective\ncommunicator right out of the gate.\n\nBusiness communication can be thought of as a problem solving activity in which individuals may address the\nfollowing questions:\n\n\u2022 What is the situation?\n\n\u2022 What are some possible communication strategies?\n\n\u2022 What is the best course of action?\n\n\u2022 What is the best way to design the chosen message?\n\n\u2022 What is the best way to deliver the message?\n\nIn this book, we will examine this problem solving process and help you learn to apply it in the kinds of situations\nyou are likely to encounter over the course of your career.\n\nCommunication Influences Your Thinking about Yourself and OthersCommunication Influences Your Thinking about Yourself and Others\n\nWe all share a fundamental drive to communicate. Communication can be defined as the process of understanding\nand sharing meaning (Pearson & Nelson, 2000). You share meaning in what you say and how you say it, both\n\n3\n\n\n\nin oral and written forms. If you could not communicate, what would life be like? A series of never-ending\nfrustrations? Not being able to ask for what you need or even to understand the needs of others?\n\nBeing unable to communicate might even mean losing a part of yourself, for you communicate your self-\nconcept\u2014your sense of self and awareness of who you are\u2014in many ways. Do you like to write? Do you find\nit easy to make a phone call to a stranger or to speak to a room full of people? Perhaps someone told you that\nyou don\u2019t speak clearly or your grammar needs improvement. Does that make you more or less likely to want to\ncommunicate? For some, it may be a positive challenge, while for others it may be discouraging. But in all cases,\nyour ability to communicate is central to your self-concept.\n\nTake a look at your clothes. What are the brands you are wearing? What do you think they say about you? Do you\nfeel that certain styles of shoes, jewelry, tattoos, music, or even automobiles express who you are? Part of your\nself-concept may be that you express yourself through texting, or through writing longer documents like essays\nand research papers, or through the way you speak.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, your communications skills help you to understand others\u2014not just their words, but\nalso their tone of voice, their nonverbal gestures, or the format of their written documents provide you with clues\nabout who they are and what their values and priorities may be. Active listening and reading are also part of being\na successful communicator.\n\nCommunication Influences How You LearnCommunication Influences How You Learn\n\nWhen you were an infant, you learned to talk over a period of many months. When you got older, you didn\u2019t learn\nto ride a bike, drive a car, or even text a message on your cell phone in one brief moment. You need to begin the\nprocess of improving your speaking and writing with the frame of mind that it will require effort, persistence, and\nself-correction.\n\nYou learn to speak in public by first having conversations, then by answering questions and expressing your\nopinions in class, and finally by preparing and delivering a \u201cstand-up\u201d speech. Similarly, you learn to write by\nfirst learning to read, then by writing and learning to think critically. Your speaking and writing are reflections of\nyour thoughts, experience, and education. Part of that combination is your level of experience listening to other\nspeakers, reading documents and styles of writing, and studying formats similar to what you aim to produce.\n\nAs you study business communication, you may receive suggestions for improvement and clarification from\nspeakers and writers more experienced than yourself. Take their suggestions as challenges to improve; don\u2019t give\nup when your first speech or first draft does not communicate the message you intend. Stick with it until you get it\nright. Your success in communicating is a skill that applies to almost every field of work, and it makes a difference\nin your relationships with others.\n\nRemember, luck is simply a combination of preparation and timing. You want to be prepared to communicate well\nwhen given the opportunity. Each time you do a good job, your success will bring more success.\n\nCommunication Represents You and Your EmployerCommunication Represents You and Your Employer\n\nYou want to make a good first impression on your friends and family, instructors, and employer. They all want\n\n4 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\nyou to convey a positive image, as it reflects on them. In your career, you will represent your business or company\nin spoken and written form. Your professionalism and attention to detail will reflect positively on you and set you\nup for success.\n\nIn both oral and written situations, you will benefit from having the ability to communicate clearly. These are\nskills you will use for the rest of your life. Positive improvements in these skills will have a positive impact on\nyour relationships, your prospects for employment, and your ability to make a difference in the world.\n\nCommunication Skills Are Desired by Business and IndustryCommunication Skills Are Desired by Business and Industry\n\nOral and written communication proficiencies are consistently ranked in the top ten desirable skills by employer\nsurveys year after year. In fact, high-powered business executives sometimes hire consultants to coach them in\nsharpening their communication skills. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, the\nfollowing are the top five personal qualities or skills potential employers seek:\n\n1. Communication skills (verbal and written)\n\n2. Strong work ethic\n\n3. Teamwork skills (works well with others, group communication)\n\n4. Initiative\n\n5. Analytical skills\n\nKnowing this, you can see that one way for you to be successful and increase your promotion potential is to\nincrease your abilities to speak and write effectively.\n\n1.1 WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE WELL? \u2022 5\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1\n\nEffective communication skills are assets that will get you there.\n\nMaryland GovPics \u2013 Baltimore Jewish Council Meeting \u2013 CC BY 2.0.\n\nIn September 2004, the National Commission on Writing for America\u2019s Families, Schools, and Colleges published\na study on 120 human resource directors titled Writing: A Ticket to Work\u2026Or a Ticket Out, A Survey of Business\nLeaders. The study found that \u201cwriting is both a \u2018marker\u2019 of high-skill, high-wage, professional work and a\n\u2018gatekeeper\u2019 with clear equity implications,\u201d said Bob Kerrey, president of New School University in New York\nand chair of the commission. \u201cPeople unable to express themselves clearly in writing limit their opportunities for\nprofessional, salaried employment.\u201d (The College Board, 2004)\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, it is estimated that over forty million Americans are illiterate, or unable to\nfunctionally read or write.

Define communication and describe communication as a process.\n\n2. Identify and describe the eight essential components of communication.\n\n3. Identify and describe two models of communication.\n\nMany theories have been proposed to describe, predict, and understand the behaviors and phenomena of which\ncommunication consists. When it comes to communicating in business, we are often less interested in theory than\nin making sure our communications generate the desired results. But in order to achieve results, it can be valuable\nto understand what communication is and how it works.\n\nDefining CommunicationDefining Communication\n\nThe root of the word \u201ccommunication\u201d in Latin is communicare, which means to share, or to make common\n(Weekley, 1967). Communication is defined as the process of understanding and sharing meaning (Pearson &\nNelson, 2000).\n\nAt the center of our study of communication is the relationship that involves interaction between participants.\nThis definition serves us well with its emphasis on the process, which we\u2019ll examine in depth across this text, of\ncoming to understand and share another\u2019s point of view effectively.\n\nThe first key word in this definition is process. A process is a dynamic activity that is hard to describe because it\nchanges (Pearson & Nelson, 2000). Imagine you are alone in your kitchen thinking. Someone you know (say, your\nmother) enters the kitchen and you talk briefly. What has changed? Now, imagine that your mother is joined by\nsomeone else, someone you haven\u2019t met before\u2014and this stranger listens intently as you speak, almost as if you\nwere giving a speech. What has changed? Your perspective might change, and you might watch your words more\nclosely. The feedback or response from your mother and the stranger (who are, in essence, your audience) may\ncause you to reevaluate what you are saying. When we interact, all these factors\u2014and many more\u2014influence the\nprocess of communication.\n\n8\n\n\n\nThe second key word is understanding: \u201cTo understand is to perceive, to interpret, and to relate our perception and\ninterpretation to what we already know.\u201d (McLean, 2003) If a friend tells you a story about falling off a bike, what\nimage comes to mind? Now your friend points out the window and you see a motorcycle lying on the ground.\nUnderstanding the words and the concepts or objects they refer to is an important part of the communication\nprocess.\n\nNext comes the word sharing. Sharing means doing something together with one or more people. You may share\na joint activity, as when you share in compiling a report; or you may benefit jointly from a resource, as when\nyou and several coworkers share a pizza. In communication, sharing occurs when you convey thoughts, feelings,\nideas, or insights to others. You can also share with yourself (a process called intrapersonal communication) when\nyou bring ideas to consciousness, ponder how you feel about something, or figure out the solution to a problem\nand have a classic \u201cAha!\u201d moment when something becomes clear.\n\nFinally, meaning is what we share through communication. The word \u201cbike\u201d represents both a bicycle and a short\nname for a motorcycle. By looking at the context the word is used in and by asking questions, we can discover the\nshared meaning of the word and understand the message.\n\nEight Essential Components of CommunicationEight Essential Components of Communication\n\nIn order to better understand the communication process, we can break it down into a series of eight essential\ncomponents:\n\n1. Source\n\n2. Message\n\n3. Channel\n\n4. Receiver\n\n5. Feedback\n\n6. Environment\n\n7. Context\n\n8. Interference\n\nEach of these eight components serves an integral function in the overall process. Let\u2019s explore them one by one.\n\nSourceSource\n\nThe source imagines, creates, and sends the message. In a public speaking situation, the source is the person\ngiving the speech. He or she conveys the message by sharing new information with the audience. The speaker also\nconveys a message through his or her tone of voice, body language, and choice of clothing. The speaker begins\nby first determining the message\u2014what to say and how to say it. The second step involves encoding the message\nby choosing just the right order or the perfect words to convey the intended meaning. The third step is to present\nor send the information to the receiver or audience. Finally, by watching for the audience\u2019s reaction, the source\nperceives how well they received the message and responds with clarification or supporting information.\n\n1.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION? \u2022 9\n\n\n\nMessageMessage\n\n\u201cThe message is the stimulus or meaning produced by the source for the receiver or audience.\u201d (McLean, 2005)\nWhen you plan to give a speech or write a report, your message may seem to be only the words you choose\nthat will convey your meaning. But that is just the beginning. The words are brought together with grammar and\norganization. You may choose to save your most important point for last. The message also consists of the way\nyou say it\u2014in a speech, with your tone of voice, your body language, and your appearance\u2014and in a report, with\nyour writing style, punctuation, and the headings and formatting you choose. In addition, part of the message may\nbe the environment or context you present it in and the noise that might make your message hard to hear or see.\n\nImagine, for example, that you are addressing a large audience of sales reps and are aware there is a World\nSeries game tonight. Your audience might have a hard time settling down, but you may choose to open with, \u201cI\nunderstand there is an important game tonight.\u201d In this way, by expressing verbally something that most people in\nyour audience are aware of and interested in, you might grasp and focus their attention.\n\nChannelChannel\n\n\u201cThe channel is the way in which a message or messages travel between source and receiver.\u201d (McLean, 2005)\nFor example, think of your television. How many channels do you have on your television? Each channel takes\nup some space, even in a digital world, in the cable or in the signal that brings the message of each channel to\nyour home. Television combines an audio signal you hear with a visual signal you see. Together they convey the\nmessage to the receiver or audience. Turn off the volume on your television. Can you still understand what is\nhappening? Many times you can, because the body language conveys part of the message of the show. Now turn\nup the volume but turn around so that you cannot see the television. You can still hear the dialogue and follow the\nstory line.\n\nSimilarly, when you speak or write, you are using a channel to convey your message. Spoken channels include\nface-to-face conversations, speeches, telephone conversations and voice mail messages, radio, public address\nsystems, and voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Written channels include letters, memorandums, purchase\norders, invoices, newspaper and magazine articles, blogs, e-mail, text messages, tweets, and so forth.\n\nReceiverReceiver\n\n\u201cThe receiver receives the message from the source, analyzing and interpreting the message in ways both intended\nand unintended by the source.\u201d (McLean, 2005) To better understand this component, think of a receiver on a\nfootball team. The quarterback throws the football (message) to a receiver, who must see and interpret where to\ncatch the ball. The quarterback may intend for the receiver to \u201ccatch\u201d his message in one way, but the receiver\nmay see things differently and miss the football (the intended meaning) altogether.\n\nAs a receiver you listen, see, touch, smell, and\/or taste to receive a message. Your audience \u201csizes you up,\u201d much\nas you might check them out long before you take the stage or open your mouth. The nonverbal responses of your\nlisteners can serve as clues on how to adjust your opening. By imagining yourself in their place, you anticipate\nwhat you would look for if you were them. Just as a quarterback plans where the receiver will be in order to place\n\n10 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\nthe ball correctly, you too can recognize the interaction between source and receiver in a business communication\ncontext. All of this happens at the same time, illustrating why and how communication is always changing.\n\nFeedbackFeedback\n\nWhen you respond to the source, intentionally or unintentionally, you are giving feedback. Feedback is composed\nof messages the receiver sends back to the source. Verbal or nonverbal, all these feedback signals allow the source\nto see how well, how accurately (or how poorly and inaccurately) the message was received. Feedback also\nprovides an opportunity for the receiver or audience to ask for clarification, to agree or disagree, or to indicate\nthat the source could make the message more interesting. As the amount of feedback increases, the accuracy of\ncommunication also increases (Leavitt & Mueller, 1951).\n\nFor example, suppose you are a sales manager participating in a conference call with four sales reps. As the\nsource, you want to tell the reps to take advantage of the fact that it is World Series season to close sales on\nbaseball-related sports gear. You state your message, but you hear no replies from your listeners. You might\nassume that this means they understood and agreed with you, but later in the month you might be disappointed\nto find that very few sales were made. If you followed up your message with a request for feedback (\u201cDoes this\nmake sense? Do any of you have any questions?\u201d) you might have an opportunity to clarify your message, and to\nfind out whether any of the sales reps believed your suggestion would not work with their customers.\n\nEnvironmentEnvironment\n\n\u201cThe environment is the atmosphere, physical and psychological, where you send and receive messages.\u201d\n(McLean, 2005) The environment can include the tables, chairs, lighting, and sound equipment that are in the\nroom. The room itself is an example of the environment. The environment can also include factors like formal\ndress, that may indicate whether a discussion is open and caring or more professional and formal. People may be\nmore likely to have an intimate conversation when they are physically close to each other, and less likely when\nthey can only see each other from across the room. In that case, they may text each other, itself an intimate form of\ncommunication. The choice to text is influenced by the environment. As a speaker, your environment will impact\nand play a role in your speech. It\u2019s always a good idea to go check out where you\u2019ll be speaking before the day of\nthe actual presentation.\n\nContextContext\n\n\u201cThe context of the communication interaction involves the setting, scene, and expectations of the individuals\ninvolved.\u201d (McLean, 2005) A professional communication context may involve business suits (environmental\ncues) that directly or indirectly influence expectations of language and behavior among the participants.\n\nA presentation or discussion does not take place as an isolated event. When you came to class, you came from\nsomewhere. So did the person seated next to you, as did the instructor. The degree to which the environment is\nformal or informal depends on the contextual expectations for communication held by the participants. The person\nsitting next to you may be used to informal communication with instructors, but this particular instructor may\nbe used to verbal and nonverbal displays of respect in the academic environment. You may be used to formal\ninteractions with instructors as well, and find your classmate\u2019s question of \u201cHey Teacher, do we have homework\n\n1.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION? \u2022 11\n\n\n\ntoday?\u201d as rude and inconsiderate when they see it as normal. The nonverbal response from the instructor will\ncertainly give you a clue about how they perceive the interaction, both the word choices and how they were said.\n\nContext is all about what people expect from each other, and we often create those expectations out of\nenvironmental cues. Traditional gatherings like weddings or quincea\u00f1eras are often formal events. There is a time\nfor quiet social greetings, a time for silence as the bride walks down the aisle, or the father may have the first\ndance with his daughter as she is transformed from a girl to womanhood in the eyes of her community. In either\ncelebration there may come a time for rambunctious celebration and dancing. You may be called upon to give a\ntoast, and the wedding or quincea\u00f1era context will influence your presentation, timing, and effectiveness.\n\nFigure 1.2\n\nContext is all about what people expect from each other.\n\nToshihiro Gamo \u2013 Marriage Matrix \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\n\nIn a business meeting, who speaks first? That probably has some relation to the position and role each person has\noutside the meeting. Context plays a very important role in communication, particularly across cultures.\n\nInterferenceInterference\n\nInterference, also called noise, can come from any source. \u201cInterference is anything that blocks or changes the\nsource\u2019s intended meaning of the message.\u201d(McLean, 2005) For example, if you drove a car to work or school,\n\n12 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/10\/1.2.0.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/10\/1.2.0.jpg\nhttps:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/dakiny\/16815605295\/\n\n\nchances are you were surrounded by noise. Car horns, billboards, or perhaps the radio in your car interrupted your\nthoughts, or your conversation with a passenger.\n\nPsychological noise is what happens when your thoughts occupy your attention while you are hearing, or reading,\na message. Imagine that it is 4:45 p.m. and your boss, who is at a meeting in another city, e-mails you asking for\nlast month\u2019s sales figures, an analysis of current sales projections, and the sales figures from the same month for\nthe past five years. You may open the e-mail, start to read, and think, \u201cGreat\u2014no problem\u2014I have those figures\nand that analysis right here in my computer.\u201d You fire off a reply with last month\u2019s sales figures and the current\nprojections attached. Then, at five o\u2019clock, you turn off your computer and go home. The next morning, your boss\ncalls on the phone to tell you he was inconvenienced because you neglected to include the sales figures from the\nprevious years. What was the problem? Interference: by thinking about how you wanted to respond to your boss\u2019s\nmessage, you prevented yourself from reading attentively enough to understand the whole message.\n\nInterference can come from other sources, too. Perhaps you are hungry, and your attention to your current situation\ninterferes with your ability to listen. Maybe the office is hot and stuffy. If you were a member of an audience\nlistening to an executive speech, how could this impact your ability to listen and participate?\n\nNoise interferes with normal encoding and decoding of the message carried by the channel between source and\nreceiver. Not all noise is bad, but noise interferes with the communication process. For example, your cell phone\nringtone may be a welcome noise to you, but it may interrupt the communication process in class and bother your\nclassmates.\n\nTwo Models of CommunicationTwo Models of Communication\n\nResearchers have observed that when communication takes place, the source and the receiver may send messages\nat the same time, often overlapping. You, as the speaker, will often play both roles, as source and receiver. You\u2019ll\nfocus on the communication and the reception of your messages to the audience. The audience will respond in\nthe form of feedback that will give you important clues. While there are many models of communication, here we\nwill focus on two that offer perspectives and lessons for business communicators.\n\nRather than looking at the source sending a message and someone receiving it as two distinct acts, researchers\noften view communication as a transactional process (Figure 1.3 \u201cTransactional Model of Communication\u201d), with\nactions often happening at the same time. The distinction between source and receiver is blurred in conversational\nturn-taking, for example, where both participants play both roles simultaneously.\n\nFigure 1.3 Transactional Model of Communication\n\nResearchers have also examined the idea that we all construct our own interpretations of the message. As the State\nDepartment quote at the beginning of this chapter indicates, what I said and what you heard may be different.\n\n1.2 WHAT IS COMMUNICATION? \u2022 13\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/c08cc636e40196770be4d9289678f8ae.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/c08cc636e40196770be4d9289678f8ae.jpg\n\n\nIn the constructivist model (Figure 1.4 \u201cConstructivist Model of Communication\u201d), we focus on the negotiated\nmeaning, or common ground, when trying to describe communication (Pearce & Cronen, 1980),\n\nImagine that you are visiting Atlanta, Georgia, and go to a restaurant for dinner. When asked if you want a \u201cCoke,\u201d\nyou may reply, \u201csure.\u201d The waiter may then ask you again, \u201cwhat kind?\u201d and you may reply, \u201cCoke is fine.\u201d The\nwaiter then may ask a third time, \u201cwhat kind of soft drink would you like?\u201d The misunderstanding in this example\nis that in Atlanta, the home of the Coca-Cola Company, most soft drinks are generically referred to as \u201cCoke.\u201d\nWhen you order a soft drink, you need to specify what type, even if you wish to order a beverage that is not a\ncola or not even made by the Coca-Cola Company. To someone from other regions of the United States, the words\n\u201cpop,\u201d \u201csoda pop,\u201d or \u201csoda\u201d may be the familiar way to refer to a soft drink; not necessarily the brand \u201cCoke.\u201d In\nthis example, both you and the waiter understand the word \u201cCoke,\u201d but you each understand it to mean something\ndifferent. In order to communicate, you must each realize what the term means to the other person, and establish\ncommon ground, in order to fully understand the request and provide an answer.\n\nFigure 1.4 Constructivist Model of Communication\n\nBecause we carry the multiple meanings of words, gestures, and ideas within us, we can use a dictionary to guide\nus, but we will still need to negotiate meaning.\n\n14 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/e18dc3e43bf86801e44729d6497ca5c1.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/e18dc3e43bf86801e44729d6497ca5c1.jpg\n\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nThe communication process involves understanding, sharing, and meaning, and it consists of eight\nessential elements: source, message, channel, receiver, feedback, environment, context, and interference.\nAmong the models of communication are the transactional process, in which actions happen\nsimultaneously, and the constructivist model, which focuses on shared meaning.\n\nExercises\n\n1. Draw what you think communication looks like. Share your drawing with your classmates.\n\n2. List three environmental cues and indicate how they influence your expectations for\ncommunication. Please share your results with your classmates.\n\n3. How does context influence your communication? Consider the language and culture people grew\nup with, and the role these play in communication styles.\n\n4. If you could design the perfect date, what activities, places, and\/or environmental cues would you\ninclude to set the mood? Please share your results with your classmates.\n\n5. Observe two people talking. Describe their communication. See if you can find all eight\ncomponents and provide an example for each one.\n\n6. What assumptions are present in transactional model of communication? Find an example of a\nmodel of communication in your workplace or classroom, and provide an example for all eight\ncomponents.\n\nReferencesReferences\n\nCronen, V., & Pearce, W. B. (1982).

Identify and describe five types of communication contexts.\n\nNow that we have examined the eight components of communication, let\u2019s examine this in context. Is a quiet\ndinner conversation with someone you care about the same experience as a discussion in class or giving a speech?\nIs sending a text message to a friend the same experience as writing a professional project proposal or a purchase\norder? Each context has an influence on the communication process. Contexts can overlap, creating an even more\ndynamic process. You have been communicating in many of these contexts across your lifetime, and you\u2019ll be\nable to apply what you\u2019ve learned through experience in each context to business communication.\n\nIntrapersonal CommunicationIntrapersonal Communication\n\nHave you ever listened to a speech or lecture and gotten caught up in your thoughts so that, while the speaker\ncontinued, you were no longer listening? During a phone conversation, have you ever been thinking about what\nyou are going to say, or what question you might ask, instead of listening to the other person? Finally, have you\never told yourself how you did after you wrote a document or gave a presentation? As you \u201ctalk with yourself\u201d\nyou are engaged in intrapersonal communication.\n\nIntrapersonal communication involves one person; it is often called \u201cself-talk.\u201d (Wood, 1997) Donna Vocate\u2019s\nbook on intrapersonal communication explains how, as we use language to reflect on our own experiences, we\ntalk ourselves through situations. For example, the voice within you that tells you, \u201cKeep on Going! I can DO\nIT!\u201d when you are putting your all into completing a five-mile race; or that says, \u201cThis report I\u2019ve written is pretty\ngood.\u201d Your intrapersonal communication can be positive or negative, and directly influences how you perceive\nand react to situations and communication with others.\n\nWhat you perceive in communication with others is also influenced by your culture, native language, and your\nworld view. As the German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas said, \u201cEvery process of reaching understanding takes\nplace against the background of a culturally ingrained preunderstanding.\u201d (Habermas, 1984)\n\nFor example, you may have certain expectations of time and punctuality. You weren\u2019t born with them, so where\n\n16\n\n\n\ndid you learn them? From those around you as you grew up. What was normal for them became normal for you,\nbut not everyone\u2019s idea of normal is the same.\n\nWhen your supervisor invites you to a meeting and says it will start at 7 p.m., does that mean 7:00 sharp, 7-ish,\nor even 7:30? In the business context, when a meeting is supposed to start at 9 a.m., is it promptly a 9 a.m.?\nVariations in time expectations depend on regional and national culture as well as individual corporate cultures.\nIn some companies, everyone may be expected to arrive ten to fifteen minutes before the announced start time\nto take their seats and be ready to commence business at 9:00 sharp. In other companies, \u201cmeeting and greeting\u201d\nfrom about 9 to 9:05 or even 9:10 is the norm. When you are unfamiliar with the expectations for a business event,\nit is always wise to err on the side of being punctual, regardless of what your internal assumptions about time and\npunctuality may be.\n\nInterpersonal CommunicationInterpersonal Communication\n\nThe second major context within the field of communication is interpersonal communication. Interpersonal\ncommunication normally involves two people, and can range from intimate and very personal to formal and\nimpersonal. You may carry on a conversation with a loved one, sharing a serious concern. Later, at work, you\nmay have a brief conversation about plans for the weekend with the security guard on your way home. What\u2019s\nthe difference? Both scenarios involve interpersonal communication, but are different in levels of intimacy. The\nfirst example implies a trusting relationship established over time between two caring individuals. The second\nexample level implies some previous familiarity, and is really more about acknowledging each other than any\nactual exchange of information, much like saying hello or goodbye.\n\nGroup CommunicationGroup Communication\n\nHave you ever noticed how a small group of people in class sit near each other? Perhaps they are members of the\nsame sports program, or just friends, but no doubt they often engage in group communication.\n\n\u201cGroup communication is a dynamic process where a small number of people engage in a conversation.\u201d\n(McLean, 2005) Group communication is generally defined as involving three to eight people. The larger the\ngroup, the more likely it is to break down into smaller groups.\n\nTo take a page from marketing, does your audience have segments or any points of convergence\/divergence?\nWe could consider factors like age, education, sex, and location to learn more about groups and their general\npreferences as well as dislikes. You may find several groups within the larger audience, such as specific areas of\neducation, and use this knowledge to increase your effectiveness as a business communicator.\n\nPublic CommunicationPublic Communication\n\nIn public communication, one person speaks to a group of people; the same is true of public written\ncommunication, where one person writes a message to be read by a small or large group. The speaker or writer\nmay ask questions, and engage the audience in a discussion (in writing, examples are an e-mail discussion or a\npoint-counter-point series of letters to the editor), but the dynamics of the conversation are distinct from group\n\n1.3 COMMUNICATION IN CONTEXT \u2022 17\n\n\n\ncommunication, where different rules apply. In a public speaking situation, the group normally defers to the\nspeaker. For example, the boss speaks to everyone, and the sales team quietly listens without interruption.\n\nThis generalization is changing as norms and expectations change, and many cultures have a tradition of \u201ccall\nouts\u201d or interjections that are not to be interpreted as interruptions or competition for the floor, but instead\nas affirmations. The boss may say, as part of a charged-up motivational speech, \u201cDo you hear me?\u201d and the\nsales team is expected to call back \u201cYes Sir!\u201d The boss, as a public speaker, recognizes that intrapersonal\ncommunication (thoughts of the individual members) or interpersonal communication (communication between\nteam members) may interfere with this classic public speaking dynamic of all to one, or the audience devoting\nall its attention to the speaker, and incorporate attention getting and engagement strategies to keep the sales team\nfocused on the message.\n\nMass CommunicationMass Communication\n\nHow do you tell everyone on campus where and when all the classes are held? Would a speech from the front\nsteps work? Perhaps it might meet the need if your school is a very small one. A written schedule that lists all\nclasses would be a better alternative. How do you let everyone know there is a sale on in your store, or that your\nnew product will meet their needs, or that your position on a political issue is the same as your constituents?\nYou send a message to as many people as you can through mass communication. Does everyone receive mass\ncommunication the same way the might receive a personal phone call? Not likely. Some people who receive mass\nmailings assume that they are \u201cjunk mail\u201d (i.e., that they do not meet the recipients\u2019 needs) and throw them away\nunopened. People may tune out a television advertisement with a click of the mute button, delete tweets or ignore\nfriend requests on Facebook by the hundreds, or send all unsolicited e-mail straight to the spam folder unread.\n\nMass media is a powerful force in modern society and our daily lives, and is adapting rapidly to new technologies.\nMass communication involves sending a single message to a group. It allows us to communicate our message to\na large number of people, but we are limited in our ability to tailor our message to specific audiences, groups, or\nindividuals. As a business communicator, you can use multimedia as a visual aid or reference common programs,\nfilms, or other images that your audience finds familiar yet engaging. You can tweet a picture that is worth far\nmore than 140 characters, and you are just as likely to elicit a significant response. By choosing messages or\nreferences that many audience members will recognize or can identify with, you can develop common ground and\nincrease the appeal of your message.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nCommunication contexts include intrapersonal, interpersonal, group, public, and mass communication.\nEach context has its advantages and disadvantages, and its appropriate and inappropriate uses.\n\n18 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n1. Please recall a time when you gave a speech in front of a group. How did you feel? What was\nyour experience? What did you learn from your experience?\n\n2. If you were asked to get the attention of your peers, what image or word would you choose and\nwhy?\n\n3. If you were asked to get the attention of someone like yourself, what image or word would you\nchoose and why?\n\n4. Make a list of mass communication messages you observe for a one hour period of time. Share\nyour list with classmates.\n\nReferencesReferences\n\nHabermas, J. (1984).

Discuss and provide several examples of each of the two main responsibilities of a business\ncommunicator.\n\nWhenever you speak or write in a business environment, you have certain responsibilities to your audience, your\nemployer, and your profession. Your audience comes to you with an inherent set of expectations that you will\nfulfill these responsibilities. The specific expectations may change given the context or environment, but two\ncentral ideas will remain: be prepared, and be ethical.\n\nCommunicator Is PreparedCommunicator Is Prepared\n\nAs the business communicator\u2019s first responsibility, preparation includes several facets which we will examine:\norganization, clarity, and being concise and punctual.\n\nBeing prepared means that you have selected a topic appropriate to your audience, gathered enough information\nto cover the topic well, put your information into a logical sequence, and considered how best to present it. If your\ncommunication is a written one, you have written an outline and at least one rough draft, read it over to improve\nyour writing and correct errors, and sought feedback where appropriate. If your communication is oral, you have\npracticed several times before your actual performance.\n\nThe Prepared Communicator Is OrganizedThe Prepared Communicator Is Organized\n\nPart of being prepared is being organized. Aristotle called this logos, or logic, and it involves the steps or points\nthat lead your communication to a conclusion. Once you\u2019ve invested time in researching your topic, you will\nwant to narrow your focus to a few key points and consider how you\u2019ll present them. On any given topic there\nis a wealth of information; your job is to narrow that content down to a manageable level, serving the role of\ngatekeeper by selecting some information and \u201cde-selecting,\u201d or choosing to not include other points or ideas.\n\nYou also need to consider how to link your main points together for your audience. Use transitions to provide\n\n20\n\n\n\nsignposts or cues for your audience to follow along. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve examined X, let\u2019s consider Y\u201d is a\ntransitional statement that provides a cue that you are moving from topic to topic. Your listeners or readers will\nappreciate your being well organized so that they can follow your message from point to point.\n\nThe Prepared Communicator Is ClearThe Prepared Communicator Is Clear\n\nYou have probably had the unhappy experience of reading or listening to a communication that was vague and\nwandering. Part of being prepared is being clear. If your message is unclear, the audience will lose interest and\ntune you out, bringing an end to effective communication.\n\nInterestingly, clarity begins with intrapersonal communication: you need to have a clear idea in your mind of\nwhat you want to say before you can say it clearly to someone else. At the interpersonal level, clarity involves\nconsidering your audience, as you will want to choose words and phrases they understand and avoid jargon or\nslang that may be unfamiliar to them.\n\nClarity also involves presentation. A brilliant message scrawled in illegible handwriting, or in pale gray type on\ngray paper, will not be clear. When it comes to oral communication, if you mumble your words, speak too quickly\nor use a monotonous tone of voice, or stumble over certain words or phrases, the clarity of your presentation will\nsuffer.\n\nTechnology also plays a part; if you are using a microphone or conducting a teleconference, clarity will depend\non this equipment functioning properly\u2014which brings us back to the importance of preparation. In this case, in\naddition to preparing your speech, you need to prepare by testing the equipment ahead of time.\n\nThe Prepared Communicator Is Concise and PunctualThe Prepared Communicator Is Concise and Punctual\n\nConcise means brief and to the point. In most business communications you are expected to \u201cget down to\nbusiness\u201d right away. Being prepared includes being able to state your points clearly and support them with clear\nevidence in a relatively straightforward, linear way.\n\nIt may be tempting to show how much you know by incorporating additional information into your document or\nspeech, but in so doing you run the risk of boring, confusing, or overloading your audience. Talking in circles\nor indulging in tangents, where you get off topic or go too deep, can hinder an audience\u2019s ability to grasp your\nmessage. Be to the point and concise in your choice of words, organization, and even visual aids.\n\nBeing concise also involves being sensitive to time constraints. How many times have you listened to a speaker\nsay \u201cin conclusion\u201d only to continue speaking for what seems like forever? How many meetings and conference\ncalls have you attended that got started late or ran beyond the planned ending time? The solution, of course, is\nto be prepared to be punctual. If you are asked to give a five-minute presentation at a meeting, your coworkers\nwill not appreciate your taking fifteen minutes, any more than your supervisor would appreciate your submitting\na fifteen-page report when you were asked to write five pages. For oral presentations, time yourself when you\nrehearse and make sure you can deliver your message within the allotted number of minutes.\n\nFigure 1.5\n\n1.4 YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A COMMUNICATOR \u2022 21\n\n\n\nGood business communication does not waste words or time.\n\nAngelina Earley \u2013 Times! Of! The World! \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0\n\nThere is one possible exception to this principle. Many non-Western cultures prefer a less direct approach, where\nbusiness communication often begins with social or general comments that a U.S. audience might consider\nunnecessary. Some cultures also have a less strict interpretation of time schedules and punctuality. While it is\nimportant to recognize that different cultures have different expectations, the general rule holds true that good\nbusiness communication does not waste words or time.\n\nCommunicator Is EthicalCommunicator Is Ethical\n\nThe business communicator\u2019s second fundamental responsibility is to be ethical. Ethics refers to a set of\nprinciples or rules for correct conduct. It echoes what Aristotle called ethos, the communicator\u2019s good character\nand reputation for doing what is right. Communicating ethically involves being egalitarian, respectful, and\ntrustworthy\u2014overall, practicing the \u201cgolden rule\u201d of treating your audience the way you would want to be treated.\n\nCommunication can move communities, influence cultures, and change history. It can motivate people to take\nstand, consider an argument, or purchase a product. The degree to which you consider both the common good and\nfundamental principles you hold to be true when crafting your message directly relates to how your message will\naffect others.\n\nThe Ethical Communicator Is EgalitarianThe Ethical Communicator Is Egalitarian\n\nThe word \u201cegalitarian\u201d comes from the root \u201cequal.\u201d To be egalitarian is to believe in basic equality: that all\npeople should share equally in the benefits and burdens of a society. It means that everyone is entitled to the same\nrespect, expectations, access to information, and rewards of participation in a group.\n\n22 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/10\/1.4.0.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/10\/1.4.0.jpg\ndenied:%E2%80%9Dhttps:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/daedrius\/16932850886\/%E2%80%9D\n\n\nTo communicate in an egalitarian manner, speak and write in a way that is comprehensible and relevant to all\nyour listeners or readers, not just those who are \u201clike you\u201d in terms of age, gender, race or ethnicity, or other\ncharacteristics.\n\nIn business, you will often communicate to people with certain professional qualifications. For example, you may\ndraft a memo addressed to all the nurses in a certain hospital, or give a speech to all the adjusters in a certain\nbranch of an insurance company. Being egalitarian does not mean you have to avoid professional terminology\nthat is understood by nurses or insurance adjusters. But it does mean that your hospital letter should be worded\nfor all the hospital\u2019s nurses\u2014not just female nurses, not just nurses working directly with patients, not just nurses\nunder age fifty-five. An egalitarian communicator seeks to unify the audience by using ideas and language that\nare appropriate for all the message\u2019s readers or listeners.\n\nThe Ethical Communicator Is RespectfulThe Ethical Communicator Is Respectful\n\nPeople are influenced by emotions as well as logic. Aristotle named pathos, or passion, enthusiasm and energy, as\nthe third of his three important parts of communicating after logos and ethos.\n\nMost of us have probably seen an audience manipulated by a \u201ccult of personality,\u201d believing whatever the speaker\nsaid simply because of how dramatically he or she delivered a speech; by being manipulative, the speaker fails\nto respect the audience. We may have also seen people hurt by sarcasm, insults, and other disrespectful forms of\ncommunication.\n\nThis does not mean that passion and enthusiasm are out of place in business communication. Indeed, they are\nvery important. You can hardly expect your audience to care about your message if you don\u2019t show that you care\nabout it yourself. If your topic is worth writing or speaking about, make an effort to show your audience why it\nis worthwhile by speaking enthusiastically or using a dynamic writing style. Doing so, in fact, shows respect for\ntheir time and their intelligence.\n\nHowever, the ethical communicator will be passionate and enthusiastic without being disrespectful. Losing one\u2019s\ntemper and being abusive are generally regarded as showing a lack of professionalism (and could even involve\nlegal consequences for you or your employer). When you disagree strongly with a coworker, feel deeply annoyed\nwith a difficult customer, or find serious fault with a competitor\u2019s product, it is important to express such\nsentiments respectfully. For example, instead of telling a customer, \u201cI\u2019ve had it with your complaints!\u201d a respectful\nbusiness communicator might say, \u201cI\u2019m having trouble seeing how I can fix this situation. Would you explain to\nme what you want to see happen?\u201d\n\nThe Ethical Communicator Is TrustworthyThe Ethical Communicator Is Trustworthy\n\nTrust is a key component in communication, and this is especially true in business. As a consumer, would you\nchoose to buy merchandise from a company you did not trust? If you were an employer, would you hire someone\nyou did not trust?\n\nYour goal as a communicator is to build a healthy relationship with your audience, and to do that you must show\nthem why they can trust you and why the information you are about to give them is believable. One way to do this\n\n1.4 YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AS A COMMUNICATOR \u2022 23\n\n\n\nis to begin your message by providing some information about your qualifications and background, your interest\nin the topic, or your reasons for communicating at this particular time.\n\nYour audience will expect that what you say is the truth as you understand it. This means that you have not\nintentionally omitted, deleted, or taken information out of context simply to prove your points. They will listen\nto what you say and how you say it, but also to what you don\u2019t say or do. You may consider more than one\nperspective on your topic, and then select the perspective you perceive to be correct, giving concrete reasons why\nyou came to this conclusion. People in the audience may have considered or believe in some of the perspectives\nyou consider, and your attention to them will indicate you have done your homework.\n\nBeing worthy of trust is something you earn with an audience. Many wise people have observed that trust is hard\nto build but easy to lose. A communicator may not know something and still be trustworthy, but it\u2019s a violation\nof trust to pretend you know something when you don\u2019t. Communicate what you know, and if you don\u2019t know\nsomething, research it before you speak or write. If you are asked a question to which you don\u2019t know the answer,\nsay \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer but I will research it and get back to you\u201d (and then make sure you follow through\nlater). This will go over much better with the audience than trying to cover by stumbling through an answer or\nportraying yourself as knowledgeable on an issue that you are not.\n\nThe \u201cGolden Rule\u201dThe \u201cGolden Rule\u201d\n\nWhen in doubt, remember the \u201cgolden rule,\u201d which says to treat others the way you would like to be treated.\nIn all its many forms, the golden rule incorporates human kindness, cooperation, and reciprocity across cultures,\nlanguages, backgrounds and interests. Regardless of where you travel, who you communicate with, or what your\naudience is like, remember how you would feel if you were on the receiving end of your communication, and act\naccordingly.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nAs a communicator, you are responsible for being prepared and being ethical. Being prepared includes\nbeing organized, clear, concise, and punctual. Being ethical includes being egalitarian, respectful, and\ntrustworthy and overall, practicing the \u201cgolden rule.\u201d\n\nExercises\n\n1. Recall one time you felt offended or insulted in a conversation. What contributed to your\nperception? Please share your comments with classmates.\n\n2. When someone lost your trust, were they able earn it back? Please share your comments with\nclassmates?\n\n3. Does the communicator have a responsibility to the audience? Does the audience have a\nresponsibility to the speaker? Why or why not?

Speaking or writing involves sharing\nyour perspective with others. If you talk to yourself, the action is a reflection of the communication process, but\nyou play the role of audience. In your head, you may make sense of your words and their meaning, but when I hear\nwhat you said, what you meant may escape me. I might not \u201cget it\u201d because I don\u2019t know you, your references,\nyour perspectives, your word choices, or your underlying meaning and motivation for speaking in the first place.\nIn this chapter we\u2019ll discuss perspectives, and how people perceive information, as we learn how communication\nis an imperfect bridge to understanding. It requires our constant attention, maintenance, and effort.\n\nKnowing your audience involves understanding others, and their perspectives, to see if they understand your\nwords, examples, or the frames of reference you use to communicate your experiences, points, and conclusions.\nAsk yourself when you last had a miscommunication with someone. No doubt it was fairly recently, as it is for\nmost people.\n\nIt\u2019s not people\u2019s fault that language, both verbal and nonverbal, is an imperfect system. We can, however, take\nresponsibility for the utility and limitations of language to try to gain a better understanding of how we can\ncommunicate more effectively. As a communicator, consider both the role of the speaker and the audience and not\nonly what and how you want to communicate but also what and how your audience needs you to communicate\nwith them in order to present an effective message.\n\n64 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/08aec84e08ce0ecf9a3c63f12353d23a.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/08aec84e08ce0ecf9a3c63f12353d23a.jpg\n\n\nFigure 3.3 Solution to Introductory Exercise 5 (the \u201cNine-Dot Problem\u201d)\n\nTake, for example, the word \u201clove.\u201d Yes, we recognize those four little letters all in a row, but what does it really\nmean? You can use it to describe the feelings and emotions associated with your mother, a partner, or perhaps your\ndog. Or you might say you love chocolate cake. Does your use of the word in any given context allow the audience\nto get any closer to what you mean by this word, \u201clove\u201d? The key here is context, which provides clues to how you\nmean the word and what its use means to you. The context allows you to close the gap between your meaning of\n\u201clove\u201d and what the receiver, or audience, has in their range of understanding of the same word. Your experiences\nare certainly different, but through clues, contexts, and attempts to understand each other\u2019s perspectives, we can\noften communicate more effectively.\n\nThis gives rise to an issue: how do I deal with twenty or twenty-five \u201cperspectives\u201d in a classroom or a reading\naudience of infinite size and try to narrow the gap with each audience member? Before we tackle this question,\nlet\u2019s first follow the advice given by the character Polonius in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet: \u201cTo thine own self be\ntrue.\u201d This relates to the notion that you need to know yourself, or your perspective, before you can explore\nways to know others and communicate more effectively. You will examine how you perceive stimuli, choosing\nsome information over others, organizing the information according to your frame of reference, and interpreting\nit, deciding what it means to you and whether you should remember it or just ignore it and move on. We can\n\nCHAPTER 3: UNDERSTANDING YOUR AUDIENCE \u2022 65\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/44f715a8369cb6ce716779382afeb4f6.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/44f715a8369cb6ce716779382afeb4f6.jpg\n\n\nrecognize that not everyone tunes in to the same music, trends in clothing, or even classes, so experiences or\nstimuli can have different meanings.

Describe the factors that contribute to self-concept.\n\n2. Describe how the self-fulfilling prophecy works.\n\nIn the first of the Note 3.1 \u201cIntroductory Exercises\u201d for this chapter, you listed terms to describe yourself. This\nexercise focuses on your knowledge, skills, experience, interests, and relationships. Your sense of self comes\nthrough in your oral and written presentations. Public communication starts with intrapersonal communication, or\ncommunication with yourself. You need to know what you want to say before you can say it to an audience.\n\nUnderstanding your perspective can lend insight to your awareness, the ability to be conscious of events and\nstimuli. Awareness determines what you pay attention to, how you carry out your intentions, and what you\nremember of your activities and experiences each day. Awareness is a complicated and fascinating area of study.\nThe way we take in information, give it order, and assign it meaning has long interested researchers from\ndisciplines including sociology, anthropology, and psychology.\n\nYour perspective is a major factor in this dynamic process. Whether you are aware of it or not, you bring to the\nact of reading this sentence a frame of mind formed from experiences and education across your lifetime. Imagine\nthat you see a presentation about snorkeling in beautiful Hawaii as part of a travel campaign. If you have never\nbeen snorkeling but love to swim, how will your perspective lead you to pay attention to the presentation? If,\nhowever, you had a traumatic experience as a child in a pool and are now afraid of being under water, how will\nyour perspective influence your reaction?\n\nFigure 3.4\n\n67\n\n\n\nPeaceful or dangerous? Your perception influences your response.\n\nsandwich \u2013 bryan and jason, diving a wall \u2013 CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.\n\nLearning to recognize how your perspective influences your thoughts is a key step in understanding yourself and\npreparing to communicate with others.\n\nThe communication process itself is the foundation for oral and written communication. Whether we express\nourselves in terms of a live, face-to-face conversation or across a voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) chat\nvia audio and visual channels, emoticons (:)), and abbreviations (IMHO [In My Humble Opinion]), the\ncommunication process remains the same. Imagine that you are at work and your Skype program makes the\nfamiliar noise indicating that someone wants to talk. Your caller ID tells you that it is a friend. You also know\nthat you have the report right in front of you to get done before 5:00 p.m. Your friend is quite a talker, and for\nhim everything tends to have a \u201cgotta talk about it right now\u201d sense of urgency. You know a little bit about your\npotential audience or conversational partner. Do you take the call? Perhaps you chat back \u201cBusy, after 5,\u201d only\nto have him call again. You interpret the ring as his insistent need for attention, but you have priorities. You can\nchoose to close the Skype program, stop the ringing, and get on with your report, but do you? Communication\noccurs on many levels in several ways.\n\n68 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/10\/3.1.0.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/10\/3.1.0.jpg\nhttps:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/sandwichgirl\/12088901434\/\n\n\nSelf-ConceptSelf-Concept\n\nWhen we communicate, we are full of expectations, doubts, fears, and hopes. Where we place emphasis, what\nwe focus on, and how we view our potential has a direct impact on our communication interactions. You gather\na sense of self as you grow, age, and experience others and the world. At various times in your life, you have\nprobably been praised for some of your abilities and talents, and criticized for doing some things poorly. These\ncompliments and criticisms probably had a deep impact on you. Much of what we know about ourselves we\u2019ve\nlearned through interaction with others. Not everyone has had positive influences in their lives, and not every\ncritic knows what they are talking about, but criticism and praise still influence how and what we expect from\nourselves.\n\nCarol Dweck, a psychology researcher at Stanford University, states that \u201csomething that seems like a small\nintervention can have cascading effects on things we think of as stable or fixed, including extroversion, openness\nto new experience, and resilience.\u201d (Begley, 2008) Your personality and expressions of it, like oral and written\ncommunication, were long thought to have a genetic component. But, says Dweck, \u201cMore and more research is\nsuggesting that, far from being simply encoded in the genes, much of personality is a flexible and dynamic thing\nthat changes over the life span and is shaped by experience.\u201d (Begley, 2008) If you were told by someone that you\nwere not a good speaker, know this: You can change. You can shape your performance through experience, and a\nbusiness communication course, a mentor at work, or even reading effective business communication authors can\nresult in positive change.\n\nAttitudes, Beliefs, and ValuesAttitudes, Beliefs, and Values\n\nWhen you consider what makes you you, the answers multiply as do the questions. As a baby, you learned to\nrecognize that the face in the mirror was your face. But as an adult, you begin to wonder what and who you are.\nWhile we could discuss the concept of self endlessly and philosophers have wrestled and will continue to wrestle\nwith it, for our purposes, let\u2019s focus on self, which is defined as one\u2019s own sense of individuality, motivations,\nand personal characteristics (McLean, 2003). We also must keep in mind that this concept is not fixed or absolute;\ninstead it changes as we grow and change across our lifetimes.\n\nOne point of discussion useful for our study about ourselves as communicators is to examine our attitudes,\nbeliefs, and values. These are all interrelated, and researchers have varying theories as to which comes first and\nwhich springs from another. We learn our values, beliefs, and attitudes through interaction with others. Table 3.1\n\u201cAttitudes, Beliefs, and Values\u201d defines these terms and provides an example of each.\n\nTable 3.1 Attitudes, Beliefs, and Values\n\nDefinition Changeable? Example\n\nAttitudes Learned predispositions to aconcept or object\nSubject to\nchange I enjoyed the writing exercise in class today.\n\nBeliefs Convictions or expressions ofconfidence\nCan change\nover time\n\nThis course is important because I may use the communication skills I\nam learning in my career.\n\nValues Ideals that guide our behavior Generally longlasting Effective communication is important.\n\n3.1 SELF-UNDERSTANDING IS FUNDAMENTAL TO COMMUNICATION \u2022 69\n\n\n\nAn attitude is your immediate disposition toward a concept or an object. Attitudes can change easily and\nfrequently. You may prefer vanilla while someone else prefers peppermint, but if someone tries to persuade you\nof how delicious peppermint is, you may be willing to try it and find that you like it better than vanilla.\n\nBeliefs are ideas based on our previous experiences and convictions and may not necessarily be based on logic\nor fact. You no doubt have beliefs on political, economic, and religious issues. These beliefs may not have been\nformed through rigorous study, but you nevertheless hold them as important aspects of self. Beliefs often serve as\na frame of reference through which we interpret our world. Although they can be changed, it often takes time or\nstrong evidence to persuade someone to change a belief.\n\nValues are core concepts and ideas of what we consider good or bad, right or wrong, or what is worth the sacrifice.\nOur values are central to our self-image, what makes us who we are. Like beliefs, our values may not be based on\nempirical research or rational thinking, but they are even more resistant to change than are beliefs. To undergo a\nchange in values, a person may need to undergo a transformative life experience.\n\nFor example, suppose you highly value the freedom to make personal decisions, including the freedom to choose\nwhether or not to wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle. This value of individual choice is central to your way\nof thinking and you are unlikely to change this value. However, if your brother was driving a motorcycle without\na helmet and suffered an accident that fractured his skull and left him with permanent brain damage, you might\nreconsider this value. While you might still value freedom of choice in many areas of life, you might become an\nadvocate for helmet laws\u2014and perhaps also for other forms of highway safety, such as stiffer penalties for cell-\nphone talking and texting while driving.\n\nSelf-Image and Self-EsteemSelf-Image and Self-Esteem\n\nYour self-concept is composed of two main elements: self-image and self-esteem.\n\nYour self-image is how you see yourself, how you would describe yourself to others. It includes your physical\ncharacteristics\u2014your eye color, hair length, height, and so forth. It also includes your knowledge, experience,\ninterests, and relationships. If these sound familiar, go back and look at the first of the Note 3.1 \u201cIntroductory\nExercises\u201d for this chapter. In creating the personal inventory in this exercise, you identified many characteristics\nthat contribute to your self-image. In addition, image involves not just how you look but also your expectations of\nyourself\u2014what you can be.\n\nWhat is your image of yourself as a communicator? How do you feel about your ability to communicate? While\nthe two responses may be similar, they indicate different things. Your self-esteem is how you feel about yourself;\nyour feelings of self-worth, self-acceptance, and self-respect. Healthy self-esteem can be particularly important\nwhen you experience a setback or a failure. Instead of blaming yourself or thinking, \u201cI\u2019m just no good,\u201d high self-\nesteem will enable you to persevere and give yourself positive messages like \u201cIf I prepare well and try harder, I\ncan do better next time.\u201d\n\nPutting your self-image and self-esteem together yields your self-concept: your central identity and set of\nbeliefs about who you are and what you are capable of accomplishing. When it comes to communicating,\nyour self-concept can play an important part. You may find that communicating is a struggle, or the thought\nof communicating may make you feel talented and successful. Either way, if you view yourself as someone\n\n70 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\ncapable of learning new skills and improving as you go, you will have an easier time learning to be an effective\ncommunicator. Whether positive or negative, your self-concept influences your performance and the expression\nof that essential ability: communication.\n\nLooking-Glass SelfLooking-Glass Self\n\nIn addition to how we view ourselves and feel about ourselves, of course, we often take into consideration the\nopinions and behavior of others. Charles Cooley\u2019s looking-glass self reinforces how we look to others and how\nthey view us, treat us, and interact with us to gain insight of our identity. We place an extra emphasis on parents,\nsupervisors, and on those who have some degree of control over us when we look at others. Developing a sense\nof self as a communicator involves balance between constructive feedback from others and constructive self-\naffirmation. You judge yourself, as others do, and both views count.\n\nSelf-Fulfilling ProphecySelf-Fulfilling Prophecy\n\nNow, suppose that you are treated in an especially encouraging manner in one of your classes. Imagine that you\nhave an instructor who continually \u201ccatches you doing something right\u201d and praises you for your efforts and\nachievements. Would you be likely to do well in this class and perhaps go on to take more advanced courses in\nthis subject?\n\nIn a psychology experiment that has become famous through repeated trials, several public school teachers were\ntold that specific students in their classes were expected to do quite well because of their intelligence (Rosenthal\n& Jacobson, 1968). These students were identified as having special potential that had not yet \u201cbloomed.\u201d What\nthe teachers didn\u2019t know was that these \u201cspecial potential\u201d students were randomly selected. That\u2019s right: as a\ngroup, they had no more special potential than any other students.\n\nCan you anticipate the outcome? As you may guess, the students lived up to their teachers\u2019 level of expectation.\nEven though the teachers were supposed to give appropriate attention and encouragement to all students, in\nfact they unconsciously communicated special encouragement verbally and nonverbally to the special potential\nstudents. And these students, who were actually no more gifted than their peers, showed significant improvement\nby the end of the school year. This phenomenon came to be called the \u201cPygmalion effect\u201d after the myth of a\nGreek sculptor named Pygmalion, who carved a marble statue of a woman so lifelike that he fell in love with\nher\u2014and in response to his love she did in fact come to life and marry him (Rosenthal & Jacobson, 1968; Insel &\nJacobson, 1975).\n\nIn more recent studies, researchers have observed that the opposite effect can also happen: when students are seen\nas lacking potential, teachers tend to discourage them or, at a minimum, fail to give them adequate encouragement.\nAs a result, the students do poorly (Schugurensky, 2009; Anyon, 1980; Oakes, 1985; Sadker & Sadker, 1994).\n\nWhen people encourage you, it affects the way you see yourself and your potential. Seek encouragement for your\nwriting and speaking. Actively choose positive reinforcement as you develop your communication skills. You will\nmake mistakes, but the important thing is to learn from them. Keep in mind that criticism should be constructive,\nwith specific points you can address, correct, and improve.\n\nThe concept of a self-fulfilling prophecy, in which someone\u2019s behavior comes to match and mirror others\u2019\n\n3.1 SELF-UNDERSTANDING IS FUNDAMENTAL TO COMMUNICATION \u2022 71\n\n\n\nexpectations, is not new. Robert Rosenthal, a professor of social psychology at Harvard, has observed four\nprinciples while studying this interaction between expectations and performance:\n\n1. We form certain expectations of people or events.\n\n2. We communicate those expectations with various cues, verbal and nonverbal.\n\n3. People tend to respond to these cues by adjusting their behavior to match the expectations.\n\n4. The outcome is that the original expectation becomes true.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nYou can become a more effective communicator by understanding yourself and how others view you: your\nattitudes, beliefs, and values; your self-concept; and how the self-fulfilling prophecy may influence your\ndecisions.\n\nExercises\n\n1. How would you describe yourself as a public speaker? Now, five, and ten years ago? Is your\ndescription the same or does it change across time? This business communication text and course\ncan make a difference in what you might write for the category \u201cone year from today.\u201d\n\n2. How does your self-concept influence your writing? Write a one- to two-page essay on this topic\nand discuss it with a classmate.\n\n3. Make a list of at least three of your strongly held beliefs. What are those beliefs based on? List\nsome facts, respected authorities, or other evidence that support them. Share your results with your\nclass.\n\n4. What are some of the values held by people you know? Identify a target sample size (twenty is a\ngood number) and ask members of your family, friends, and peers about their values. Compare your\nresults with those of your classmates.\n\n5. Make a list of traits you share with your family members. Interview them and see if anyone else in\nyour family has shared them. Share and compare with your classmates.\n\n6. What does the field of psychology offer concerning the self-fulfilling prophecy? Investigate the\ntopic and share your findings.\n\nReferencesReferences\n\nAnyon, J. (1980, Fall).

Describe the concept of perception.\n\n2. Describe the process of selection and the factors that influence it.\n\n3. Describe several principles of organization.\n\n4. Explain how interpretation influences our perceptions.\n\nLook at the fourth of the Note 3.1 \u201cIntroductory Exercises\u201d for this chapter. If you deciphered the hidden message,\nhow did you do it? You may have tried looking for words that were diagonal or backwards, using skills you\nlearned solving similar puzzles in the past. While there are many ways to solve this puzzle, there is only one right\nanswer (McLean, 2003). Reading from right to left (not left to right), and bottom to top (not top to bottom), the\nhidden message reads: Your perspective influences how you perceive your world.\n\nWhere did you start reading on this page? The top left corner. Why not the bottom right corner, or the top right\none? In English we read left to right, from the top of the page to the bottom. But not everyone reads the same.\nIf you read and write Arabic or Hebrew, you will proceed from right to left. Neither is right or wrong, simply\ndifferent. You may find it hard to drive on the other side of the road while visiting England, but for people in the\nUnited Kingdom, it is normal and natural.\n\nWe can extend this concept in many ways. Imagine that you are doing a sales presentation to a group where the\naverage age is much older or younger than you. In terms of words to use to communicate ideas, references to\nmusic or movies, even expectations for behaviors when dating, their mental \u201croad map\u201d may be quite different\nfrom yours. Even though your sales message might focus on a product like a car, or a service like car washing,\npreconceived ideas about both will need to be addressed.\n\nFor example, how many advertisements have you seen on television that have a song from specific time period,\nlike the 1980s, or perhaps the 1960s? The music is a clear example of targeting a specific audience with something\ndistinctive, like a familiar song. When speaking or writing, your style, tone, and word choice all influence the\nreader. The degree to which you can tailor your message to their needs will be associated with an increase in\nthe overall effectiveness of your message. These differences in perspective influence communication and your\n\n74\n\n\n\nability to recognize not only your point of view but theirs will help you become \u201cother-oriented\u201d and improve\ncommunication.\n\nLook at the puzzle again and see if you can avoid seeing the solution. It\u2019ll be hard because now that you know\nwhere it is, you have a mental road map that leads you to the solution. The mental state where you could not see it,\nor perceive it, is gone. Your audience has a mental road map that includes values, experiences, beliefs, strategies\nto deal with challenges, even scripts for behavioral expectations. You need to read the maps as closely as possibly\nin order to be able to communicate from common ground.\n\nThis discussion illustrates what the German philosopher J\u00fcrgen Habermas calls preunderstanding, a set of\nexpectations and assumptions from previous experience that we apply to a new problem or situation. We draw\nfrom our experiences to help guide us to our goal, even when the situations may be completely different. We\n\u201cunderstand\u201d before we experience because we predict or apply our mental template to what we think is coming.\n\nExpectations affect our perceptions. If the teacher says, \u201cI need to see you after class\u201d your perception might\ninvolve thoughts like, \u201cWhat have I done? Why me? What does he or she want?\u201d and you may even think back to\nother times in similar situations. This may contribute to a negative perception of the meeting, and then you might\nbe surprised to learn the teacher only wanted to tell you about a scholarship opportunity. The same idea applies to\nyour audience. They will have certain expectations of you as a speaker.\n\n\u201cThe customary forms and configurations (of communication) that members expect\u201d are called conventions\n(Kostelnick, 1998). You\u2019ve probably heard the terms \u201cconventional,\u201d perhaps in relation to a \u201cconventional oven.\u201d\nThis use means a standard type oven with a heat source as opposed a microwave oven. Who decided that a stove,\nfor example, would have burners on top and a front-opening door to the oven? Why four burners and not three,\nor two? Many modern stoves have ceramic burners that are integrated in to the top of the oven, or even into the\ntop of a counter, separate from the oven. These new applications \u201cstretch\u201d the notion of what is the standard for a\nstove.\n\nPeople use conventions to guide them every day. On which side of the plate will you find the spoon? In a formal\nplace setting, the answer is \u201cright.\u201d If, however, you are at a potluck supper, you may be handed a plate with all\nyour utensils, including the spoon, just sitting on top. Or you might find a pile of spoons next to the plates and\nhave to get one for yourself. In each case there are a set of conventions in place that we use to guide behavior and\nestablish expectations. At a formal dinner, eating with your fingers might be unconventional or even rude. The\nsame actions at a potluck might be the dominant convention, as in everyone is doing it.\n\nIn business communication, conventions are always in place. The audience will have a set of expectations you\nneed to consider, and you need to keep an open mind about the importance of those expectations; but you also\nneed to achieve your goal of informing, persuading, or motivating them. If you are presenting a sales message\nand the results are zero sales, you\u2019ll have to take a long look at what you presented and develop alternative\nstrategies. Providing a different perspective to your audience while adapting to their expectations and finding\ncommon ground is a good first step in gaining and maintaining their attention.\n\nWe often make assumptions about what others are communicating and connect the dots in ways that were not\nintended by the speaker. As a business communicator, your goal is to help the audience connect the dots in the\nway you intend while limiting alternative solutions that may confuse and divide the audience.\n\n3.2 PERCEPTION \u2022 75\n\n\n\nTaking care to make sure you understand before connecting your dots and creating false expectations is a positive\nway to prepare yourself for the writing process. Do you know what the assignment is? Are the goals and\nresults clear? Do you know your audience? All these points reinforce the central theme that clear and concise\ncommunication is critical in business and industry.\n\nSelectionSelection\n\nCan you imagine what life would be like if you heard, saw, and felt every stimulus or activity in your environment\nall day long? It would be overwhelming. It is impossible to perceive, remember, process, and respond to every\naction, smell, sound, picture, or word that we see, hear, small, taste, or touch. We would be lost paying attention\nto everything, being distracted by everything, and lack focus on anything.\n\nIn the same way, a cluttered message, with no clear format or way of discerning where the important information\nis located, can overwhelm the listener. It is handy, therefore, that we as humans can choose to pay attention to\na specific stimulus while ignoring or tuning out others. This raises the question, however, of why we choose to\npay attention to one thing over another. Since we cannot pay attention to everything at once, we choose to pay\nattention to what appears to be the most relevant for us.\n\nThis action of sorting competing messages, or choosing stimuli, is called selection. Selection is one very important\npart of perception and awareness. You select what to pay attention to based on what is important to you, or what\nyou value, and that is different for each person. Let\u2019s pretend you\u2019re reading an article for class, or perhaps you\u2019re\nnot as much reading but skimming or half-listening to the author\u2019s voice in your head, and only following along\nenough to get the main idea, as you do when you scan rather than read something word for word.\n\nAt the same time you are thinking about the attractive classmate who sits in the third row, wondering when it\nwill be noon, and starting to think about what to eat for lunch. In this real-world example, we can quickly count\nthe four stimuli you\u2019ve selected to pay attention to, but not all of them receive equal attention at every moment.\nPerhaps your stomach starts to growl; while the mental image of the attractive classmate is indeed attractive, your\nstomach demands the center stage of your attention.\n\nA stage is a useful way to think about your focus or attention. There are times when you see everything on the\nstage, the literal stage in terms of theater or the page you are reading now, in print or online. The stage refers\nto the setting, scene, and context of the communication interaction, and can be equally applied to written or oral\ncommunication. This page can be a stage, where objects, symbols, and words are placed to guide your attention\nin the same way an actor striding across a theater stage will compel you.\n\nYou may perceive everything happening at once\u2014while your attention is divided, you still have a larger\nperspective. Suppose you have just come home from work and are standing by your kitchen table opening the\nday\u2019s mail. At the same time, you are planning what to cook for dinner and trying to get your dog leashed up\nto take a quick walk outside. You open a letter in a preprinted envelope whose return address is unfamiliar. The\nrelationships between the words or characters are readily apparent. With one glance you can see that the letter is\nan introduction letter with a sales message, you assess that it doesn\u2019t interest you, and into the round file (garbage\ncan) it goes.\n\nIf you were the author of that letter, you might be quite disappointed. How do you grasp a reader\u2019s attention? Part\n\n76 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\nof the solution lies in your ability to help the reader select the key point or bit of information that will lead to\n\u201cwhat else?\u201d instead of \u201cno, thanks.\u201d\n\nThe same lesson applies to public speaking, but the cues will be distinct. The audience won\u2019t throw you into\nthe round file, but mentally they may ignore you and start planning what\u2019s for dinner, tuning you out. They may\nfidget, avoid eye contact, or even get up and walk out\u2014all signs that your sales message was not well received.\n\nThere are other times where you are so focused on one character or part of the stage that you miss something going\non the other side. In the same way, as you sit in your late-morning class and focus on your growling stomach, the\ninstructor\u2019s voice becomes less of a focus until you hear laughter from your classmates. You look up to see and\nhear a friend say, \u201cWe can clearly see the power and the importance of nutrition and its impact on attention span,\u201d\nas he or she gestures in your direction. You notice that everyone is looking back at you and realize they too heard\nyour stomach. Your focus and attention are important and constantly challenged.\n\nAs we follow the bouncing ball of attention, we see how selection involves focusing on one stimulus while\nlimiting our attention on another, or ignoring it altogether. We do this as a matter of course.\n\nThe process of selection and ignoring has been discussed in both contexts of a learned behavior as well as\nsomething we are born with, as in instinct or preprogrammed behavioral patterns. Regardless of whether this\nprocess is instinctive or learned, we can easily see from the previous example how the speaker, to a degree,\ncompetes with internal and external stimuli.\n\nInternal stimuli are those that arise from within one\u2019s self, such as being hungry. External stimuli involve\nstimulation from outside one\u2019s self, such as the image of the attractive classmate or the sound of the instructor\u2019s\nvoice. As a communicator, your awareness of both of these sources of stimuli will help you recognize the\nimportance or preparation, practice, and persistence as you prepare your message with them in mind. How will\nyou help guide the audience\u2019s thoughts about your topic? How will you build attention-getting features throughout\nyour written work? How will you address issues like sleepiness when you cannot change the designated time\nof your speech, scheduled right after lunch? All these issues relate to the selection process, and to a degree the\nspeaker can influence the perception of both internal and external stimuli.\n\nSelection has three main parts: exposure, attention, and retention (Klopf, 1995). Selective exposure is both\ninformation we choose to pay attention to and information that we choose to ignore, or that is unavailable to us.\nFor example, in a class you may have been required to view a student-created YouTube video presentation on\nwhich is better for you, Gatorade or water. As your levels of exposure to stimuli influence your decisions, you\nmay think, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve heard this before,\u201d and tune the speaker out. Selective attention involves focusing on one\nstimulus, like the image of an attractive classmate, and tuning out a competing stimulus, like the instructor\u2019s voice.\nSelective retention involves choosing to remember one stimulus over another.\n\nYou may be out walking and spot a friend from the same class. Your friend may say, \u201cThe program we had to\nwatch for class said Gatorade has trans fat in it. Do you think that\u2019s true?\u201d and you may be at a loss, having no\nmemory of hearing any such thing because, while you were present in your room, you were paying attention to\nother stimuli. Furthermore, you may not be a nutrition major like your friend so that the term \u201ctrans fat\u201d may not\nmean anything to you. To someone majoring in nutrition, it might be a common term used across their classes, but\nif you are an accounting major, you may not be familiar with the term. This illustrates how one aspect of selection,\nlike exposure, can influence another aspect, like retention.\n\n3.2 PERCEPTION \u2022 77\n\n\n\nYou might then think to yourself that the point in which you tuned out in the Gatorade program has something to\ndo with this term and realize that as the speaker became technical about the nutritional and metabolic properties of\nGatorade, you lost interest because you were unfamiliar with the terms being used. This highlights one aspect of\na presentation that a speaker can focus on to influence the perception process. Not everyone in the audience will\nunderstand all the terminology, so by defining terms, providing visual aid cues, or speaking in common terms,\nyou can make your topic and its presentation more accessible to a larger percentage of your audience.\n\nNow, if you were asked to recall the basic properties of Gatorade after watching the program, could you? Even\nif you recall the general idea of the program, you may have a hard time remembering any specific property\nbecause you were focused on your hunger. Although you may have heard the words, you may not have chosen to\nlisten to them. Hearing means you heard words, but listening implies you actively chose to listen to the program,\nprocessing the sounds, following the thread of discussion, making it easier for you to recall. This again illustrates\nthe point that you chose one stimuli over another, in effect selecting what to pay attention to, and if the speaker\nwas competing for your attention with more attractive, interesting or distracting stimuli, you probably just tuned\nhim or her out, in effect deselecting them.\n\nOrganizationOrganization\n\nOrganization is the process of sorting information into logical categories or series. We often take things we\nperceive and organize them into categories based on what we have perceived previously. Think back to the\nGatorade video. Suppose the speaker started out with an attention statement and quickly moved to highlight three\nmain points in the introduction. While the attention statement got you, by the second main point you were already\nstarting to think, \u201cThis is going to be just another speech on how great Gatorade is for my body.\u201d You may think\nthis because you have already heard other speakers presented similar information and you classify what you think\nthis presentation is going to be in relation to your previous experiences.\n\nBut this speaker may have given some thought to the presentation and how to make it unique and interesting, and\nprepared their discussion on the nutritional aspects in more depth. As a result, the information may have been\norganized into categories like ingredients, how your body uses the ingredients, and what the net result is. The\nfinal conclusion might be that if you exercise and burn off the calories present in Gatorade, it might be a positive\nchoice, but if you drink it just to drink it, then it will only provide you with empty calories just like any other soft\ndrink.\n\nOrganization SchemesOrganization Schemes\n\nThe organization scheme used to create three categories focuses on nutrition and the process by which Gatorade\u2019s\ningredients are used by the body. The conclusion creates two categories of consumers. This organization scheme\ncan promote active listening and allow the audience to follow, but the speaker must take into account the\npossibility that an audience member might think, \u201cOh no, not again.\u201d To set this presentation apart from others the\naudience might have heard, the speaker could include a phrase like, \u201cIs Gatorade always for you? Not necessarily.\nLet\u2019s look at\u2026\u201d which gains attention and penetrates a stereotype.\n\nWhen you write a document or give a presentation, you may not be able to anticipate all the ways an audience\n\n78 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\nmight organize the information you present or how they might use it, but by investing time in seeing it from their\nperspective, you can improve your organization and be a more effective communicator.\n\nFor example, suppose you are assigned the task of writing a cost-benefit analysis report on a specific product\ncurrently in development. Do you already know the essential points you need to include and the common industry\nstandards for this type of report? You may not know, but you have written an essay before and appreciate the need\nfor organization. Your ability to organize information, taking something that you know or have experienced and\napplying it to new information, helps you make sense of your world.\n\nGestalt Principles of OrganizationGestalt Principles of Organization\n\nIn the early twentieth century, some psychologists thought we could examine parts of things, much as a scientist\nwould examine an atom, and make a whole and complete picture regardless of context. Their theory was that\nthe setting and scene would not influence the picture or perspective. In response to this view, other psychologists\ndeveloped what they called Gestalt principles\u2014the German word \u201cGestalt\u201d referring to the unified whole.\nAccording to Gestalt theory, context matters, and the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. What you see and\nhow you see it matters, and you yourself play a role in that perception of organization.\n\nIn the fifth of the Note 3.1 \u201cIntroductory Exercises\u201d for this chapter, you were asked to connect nine dots with\nfour straight lines, without retracing any line. Did you find a solution? (A common solution appears at the end\nof this chapter.) The key to solving this puzzle is finding a way to \u201cthink outside the box\u201d\u2014in this case, to take\nyour pencil outside the implied square, or box, formed by the three rows of dots. The physical configuration of\nthe dots contributed to the illusion of the \u201cbox.\u201d But in fact there is no box, and our tendency to see one where\none does not exist creates barriers to solving the puzzle. Gestalt theory states that we will perceive the nine dots\nas belonging to a whole\u2014a group or set having a certain shape\u2014whether or not that whole actually exists.\n\nGestalt principles apply not only to images or objects, but also to ideas and concepts. You can associate two or\nmore bits of information in predictable ways, but your perspective can influence your view of the overall idea. We\ndon\u2019t always have all the information we need to draw a conclusion, literally drawing a series of relationships to\nform a whole picture in our minds, so we often fill in the gaps. We guess and make logical leaps, even suspend\ndisbelief, all in an effort to make sense of our experiences.\n\nIn your presentations, if you jump from topic to topic or go off on a tangent, what happens to the listener\u2019s\nability to listen and follow you effectively? Why make barriers for your audience when you\u2019ve worked so hard\nto get their attention? How does this relate to Gestalt principles? By failing to recognize our natural tendency to\nwant ideas, shapes, or words to make sense, the author is confusing the reader. What happens when the reader\nis confused? He or she moves on to something else, and leaves your writing behind. The opposite of clear and\nconcise, confused, and poorly organized writing can distract and defeat even the most motivated of readers. Table\n3.2 \u201cGestalt Principles of Organization\u201d lists some of the Gestalt organization principles.\n\nTable 3.2 Gestalt Principles of Organization\n\n3.2 PERCEPTION \u2022 79\n\n\n\nPrinciple Definition Example\n\nProximity\nOrganization based on\nrelationship of space to\nobjects\n\nNext to me on the beach, I see my daughter playing with her pail and shovel; in the middle\ndistance, a trio of kayakers paddle by; farther away, I see several power boats, and in the far\ndistance, the green shore of Long Island.\n\nContinuity\nDrawing connections\nbetween things that occur in\nsequence\n\nI am beginning to notice a pattern in the absentee rate in our department. For the past year,\nmore workers have been absent on the first Friday of the month than on other days. I expect\nwe will again have many absences next Friday, as it is the first Friday of the month.\n\nSimilarity Grouping things or conceptsby properties they share\n\nTo make appliqu\u00e9d candles, (Ruffman, 2007) you will need the following:\n\n1. Decorative material to appliqu\u00e9: floral (fresh flowers, pine needles, or leaves),\nhomey (dried beans or grains) or folksy (small nuts and bolts)\n2. Candle body: fat candles (at least 4\u201d diameter to keep dried flowers away from\nflame), natural colored wax (sheets or chunks of beeswax or paraffin)\n3. Tools: a microwave flower press, a \u00bd-inch paintbrush, a tin pie plate, a chip carving\nknife or v-tool\n\nUniformity\/\nHomogeneity\n\nNoting ways in which\nconcepts or objects are alike\n\nArmored personnel carriers include the Stryker, LAV, Pandur, M113 Armored Personnel\nCarrier, Amphibious Assault Vehicle, Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle, Grizzly APC, Rhino\nRunner, Bison (armored personnel carrier), and Mamba APC.\n\nFigure and\nGround\n\nEmphasis on a single item\nthat stands out from its\nsurroundings\n\nOn a rock in Copenhagen Harbor stands the small statue of The Little Mermaid, a memorial\nto one of Denmark\u2019s most beloved citizens, Hans Christian Andersen.\n\nSymmetry\nBalancing objects or ideas\nequally from one side to the\nother\n\nRepresenting the conservative viewpoint was Wall Street Journal correspondent John\nEmshwiller; the liberal viewpoint was argued by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman.\n\nClosure\n\nTendency to use previous\nknowledge to fill in the gaps\nin an incomplete idea or\npicture\n\nThe wording of the memo was, \u201cIt is important for all employees to submit their health\ninsurance enrollment selections no than November 1,\u201d but everyone understood that it\nshould have said, \u201cno later than November 1.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s examine some of the commonly used Gestalt principles: proximity, continuation, similarity, and closure.\n\nIt makes sense that we would focus first on things around us and the degree to which they are close to us and\nto each other. Proximity is the perceptual organization of information based on physical relationship of space to\nobjects. In creating a scene for a play or movie, a stage designer knows that the audience will tend to pay attention\nto objects in the foreground, unless special emphasis is added to objects farther away. This principle extends\nto people and daily life. Just because someone is walking down the street next to someone else, this does not\nnecessarily mean they have a connection to each other\u2014they are simply in close proximity.\n\nWe also see a similar tendency in the principle of continuity. We like things to be orderly, and our brain will see\nlines and movement where none exist. Examine Figure 3.5 \u201cContinuity\u201d. What you see? Do you perceive two\nlines crossing one another? Or an X? The principle of continuity predicts that you would demonstrate a tendency\nto perceive continuous figures. The two lines cross one another, and you might even say from top to bottom or the\nreverse, when there is no motion indicated.\n\n80 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5 Continuity\n\nContinuity can also lead to a well-known logical fallacy, or false belief, involving sequence and cause-effect\nrelationships. If something happens after something else, does that mean that the first event caused the second\nevent? You wish for rain and it rains. Connected? Logic and common sense would say no. You have a dream about\na plane crash, and the next day there is a major airline crash. Did your dream cause the crash? Obviously not.\n\nWhen objects or events are similar, we tend to group them together in our minds, again making the assumption that\nthey are related by their common characteristics. Similarity is the perceptual organization of information based on\nperceived points of common characteristics across distinct items. For example, a horse, a mule, and a donkey are\ndistinct, but we perceive them as being similar to one another.\n\nThe principle of closure underscores our tendency to use previous knowledge to fill in the gaps in an incomplete\nidea or picture. If you are talking to a friend on your cell phone and the connection breaks up for a few seconds,\nyou may miss some words, but you can grasp the main idea by automatically guessing what was said. You do\nthis based on your previous history of communicating with your friend on similar topics. Do you always guess\ncorrectly? Of course not. Look at Figure 3.6.\n\nFigure 3.6\n\nDo you see a ring of Pac-Man-like circles?\n\nWhen we say we see a star, we don\u2019t really see one because there is no star. The five Pac-Man shapes in that\narrangement, however, allow our mind to say, \u201cIf this was connected to this and that was connected to that, there\nwould be a star.\u201d Sometimes the sense we make does not match reality, and we see a star where there is no star.\n\nSometimes we \u201cfill in the blanks\u201d without even being aware of it. When we speak on a topic and fail to clearly\narticulate a point or substantiate an assertion, we leave a \u201chole\u201d in our presentation that the listener may or may\nnot be aware of, but will predictably fill. This tendency to jump to conclusions may seem like a disadvantage, but\nit is only a disadvantage if you are unaware of it. If fact, it\u2019s a positive ability that allows us to infer and guess\ncorrectly, often in times of crisis when time is limited. But we don\u2019t always guess correctly. If your goal is to\n\n3.2 PERCEPTION \u2022 81\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/554fcf511ba9ae53073ff73fa6101742.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/554fcf511ba9ae53073ff73fa6101742.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/14fcb2dafb47c9fc6f948dd27ca11ae7.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/14fcb2dafb47c9fc6f948dd27ca11ae7.jpg\n\n\ncommunicate your message to the audience, then by definition you don\u2019t want a \u201cpothole\u201d to interrupt, distract,\nor create a barrier that leads to misinterpretation.\n\nInterpretationInterpretation\n\nAfter selection and organization, interpretation is the third step in the perception process. From your past\nexperiences combined with your current expectations, you assign meaning to the current stimuli. If the word\n\u201ccollege\u201d for you has meaning, then what comes to mind? If a high school student has to take the PSAT\n(Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test) in the morning, what does that word mean to him? Will his state of anxiety\nand anticipation over the importance of the exam and the unknown word of college influence how he responds\nto that word? If his parents ask, \u201cWhere are you planning on going to college?\u201d when he is simply focused on\nthe test that may influence his options, the word itself may take on a whole new meaning. It may invite issues of\ncontrol (\u201cWhich college? You are going to the college we went to, right?\u201d) or of self-esteem (\u201cAm I good enough\nto go to college?\u201d) to become associated with the word \u201ccollege.\u201d\n\nThe word itself may shift in terms of meaning across time. Let\u2019s say the high school student did well on the PSAT\nand went to the same college as his parents. Is it the same college, or just the same location and buildings? It may\nhave a tradition, but it is at the same time new and ever-changing, just like the students that arrive each year. Fast\nforward a couple of years and the college may represent a place where you studied, made friends, and came to\nknow yourself. In a few more years, you may choose to become a member of the alumni association. The meaning\nof the word \u201ccollege\u201d can shift intrapersonally across time, and can mean different things to different groups.\n\nLet\u2019s rewind and look back at a test gone bad, taken by a less than adequately prepared student from a household\nwhere there may not be sufficient resources to make the dream of college come true. The image of college may\nremain an image instead of a reality; a goal not attained. Structural barriers like socioeconomic status, parental\nand peer influences, and the need to work to support yourself or your family can all influence your decisions and\nperspective.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nPerceptions are influenced by how we select, organize, and interpret words and ideas.\n\nExercises\n\n1.

Determine how perception differs between people.\n\nSomeone may say what you consider to be a simple exclamatory sentence\u2014\u201cEarn college credit while studying\nabroad!\u201d\u2014but a thought may come to mind: \u201cHow will I fit in as an outsider in a foreign country?\u201d What makes\nyou a member of a group? How you distinguish between those who belong in our family, group, or community\nand those who do not is central to our study of communication. Learning to see issues and experiences from\nmultiple perspective can be a challenging task, but the effort is worth it. Increased understanding about each other\ncan positively impact our communication and improve the degree to which we can share and understand meaning\nacross languages, cultures, and divergent perspectives.\n\nWhy Don\u2019t We All See Eye to Eye?Why Don\u2019t We All See Eye to Eye?\n\nPeople perceive things differently. We choose to select different aspects of a message to focus our attention based\non what interests us, what is familiar to us, or what we consider important. Often, our listening skills could use\nimprovement. Listening and thinking are directly related. When you are reading, what do you hear? When you are\ntalking with someone, what do you hear? If the sound of your thoughts or voice is at least one of your answers,\nthen communication is not occurring. Try to read this paragraph again without interruption. Your tendency might\nbe to skim over the words, or to focus on key vocabulary, but if you allow your thoughts to stray from the text you\nare reading, even for a moment, you are interrupting your processing of the written word, or reading. Interruptions\nwill impair your ability to understand and retain information, and make studying even harder.\n\nIn order to better understand perception, we will examine how you choose to pay attention, remember, and\ninterpret messages within the communication process.\n\nIndividual Differences in PerceptionIndividual Differences in Perception\n\nWhy do people perceive things in different ways? To answer the question, recall that we all engage in selection, or\nchoosing some stimuli while ignoring others. We exist as individuals within a community, regardless of whether\n\n84\n\n\n\nwe are conscious of it. Do you like 80s music? Prefer the Beatles? Nothing before 2005? Your tastes in music\ninvolve the senses, and what you choose to experience is influenced by your context and environment. Your\nhabits, values, and outlook on life are influenced by where you come from and where you are.\n\nThe attributes that cause people to perceive things differently are known as individual differences. Let\u2019s examine\nseveral of the most important ones.\n\nPhysical characteristics influence how we perceive and respond to information. You may be asked to design a\nsign that says, \u201cWatch your head,\u201d which will be placed next to a six foot six inch overhang that is above floor\nlevel. While a few very tall people will have to worry about hitting their heads on the overhang, most people in\nthe world are not that tall. Tall and short individuals will perceive this sign differently.\n\nYour psychological state can also influence what you read and listen to, and why you do so. The emergency\nprocedures binder on the wall next to the first aid kit doesn\u2019t mean much to you until a coworker falls and\nsuffers some bad cuts and bruises. If you were asked to design the binder and its contents, could you anticipate a\npsychological state of anxiety that would likely be present when someone needed the information? If so, then you\nmight use clear bullet lists, concise, declarative sentences, and diagrams to communicate clearly.\n\nYour cultural background plays a significant role in what and how you perceive your world. You may be from\na culture that values community. For example, the message across the advertisement reads: Stand out from the\ncrowd. Given your cultural background, it may not be a very effective slogan to get your attention.\n\nOur perceptual set involves our attitudes, beliefs, and values about the world. Perhaps you\u2019ve heard the phrase,\n\u201cLooking at the world through rose-colored glasses\u201d and can even think of someone as an example. We experience\nthe world through mediated images and mass communication. We also come to know one another interpersonally\nin groups. All these experiences help form our mental expectations of what is happening and what will happen.\n\nThink about your brand preferences, your choice of transportation, your self-expression through your clothing,\nhaircut, and jewelry\u2014all these external symbols represent in some way how you view yourself within your\ncommunity and the world. We can extend this perspective in many ways, both positive and negative, and see that\nunderstanding the perspective of the audience takes on new levels of importance.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nOur perceptions are influenced by our individual differences and preconceived notions.\n\nExercises\n\n1. When you watch a film with friends, make a point of talking about it afterward and listen to how\neach person perceived aspects of the film. Ask them each to describe it in ten words or less. Did they\nuse the same words? Did you see it the same way, or differently? Did you catch all the points, frames\nof reference, values, or miss any information? What does this say about perception?\n\n3.3 DIFFERENCES IN PERCEPTION \u2022 85\n\n\n\n2. Think of a time when you misunderstood a message. What was your psychological state at the\ntime? Do you think you would have understood the message differently if you had been in a\ndifferent psychological state?\n\n3. Think of a time when someone misunderstood your message. What happened and why? Share and\ncompare with classmates.\n\n86 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\n3.4 Getting to Know Your Audience\n\nLearning Objective\n\n1. Describe three ways to better understand and reach your audience.\n\nWriting to your audience\u2019s expectations is key to your success, but how do you get a sense of your readers?\nResearch, time, and effort. At first glance you may think you know your audience, but if you dig a little deeper\nyou will learn more about them and become a better speaker.\n\nExamine Figure 3.7 \u201cIceberg Model\u201d, often called the iceberg model. When you see an iceberg on the ocean,\nthe great majority of its size and depth lie below your level of awareness. When you write a document or give\na presentation, each person in your reading or listening audience is like the tip of an iceberg. You may perceive\npeople of different ages, races, ethnicities, and genders, but those are only surface characteristics. This is your\nchallenge. When you communicate with a diverse audience, you are engaging in intercultural communication. The\nmore you learn about the audience, the better you will be able to navigate the waters, and your communication\ninteractions, safely and effectively.\n\n87\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7 Iceberg Model\n\nTheodore Roosevelt pointed out that \u201cthe most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing\nhow to get along with people.\u201d Knowing your audience well before you speak is essential. Here are a few\nquestions to help guide you in learning more about your audience:\n\n\u2022 How big is the audience?\n\n\u2022 What are their backgrounds, gender, age, jobs, education, and\/or interests?\n\n\u2022 Do they already know about your topic? If so, how much?\n\n\u2022 Will other materials be presented or available? If so, what are they, what do they cover, and how do they\nrelate to your message?\n\n\u2022 How much time is allotted for your presentation, or how much space do you have for your written\ndocument? Will your document or presentation stand alone or do you have the option of adding visuals,\n\n88 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/c198e4ba32e8acc1e228e73c32f4a676.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/08\/c198e4ba32e8acc1e228e73c32f4a676.jpg\n\n\naudio-visual aids, or links?\n\nDemographic TraitsDemographic Traits\n\nDemographic traits refer to the characteristics that make someone an individual, but that he or she has in common\nwith others. For example, if you were born female, then your view of the world may be different from that of a\nmale, and may be similar to that of many other females. Being female means that you share this \u201cfemaleness\u201d trait\nwith roughly half the world\u2019s population.\n\nHow does this demographic trait of being female apply to communication? For example, we might find that\nwomen tend to be more aware than the typical male of what it means to be capable of becoming pregnant, or to go\nthrough menopause. If you were giving a presentation on nutrition to a female audience, you would likely include\nmore information about nutrition during pregnancy and during menopause than you would if your audience were\nmale.\n\nWe can explore other traits by considering your audience\u2019s age, level of education, employment or career status,\nand various other groups they may belong to. Imagine that you are writing a report on the health risks associated\nwith smoking. To get your message across to an audience of twelve-year-olds, clearly you would use different\nlanguage and different examples than what you would use for an audience of adults age fifty-five and older. If\nyou were writing for a highly educated audience\u2014say, engineering school graduates\u2014you would use much more\nscholarly language and rigorous research documentation than if you were writing for first-year college students.\n\n3.4 GETTING TO KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE \u2022 89\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8\n\nTailor your message to your audience.\n\nTodd Lappin \u2013 David Byrne\u2019s \u201cPowerPoint as art\u201d lecture \u2013 CC BY-NC 2.0.\n\nWriting for readers in the insurance industry, you would likely choose examples of how insurance claims are\naffected by whether or not a policyholder smokes, whereas if you were writing for readers who are athletes, you\nwould focus on how the human body reacts to tobacco. Similarly, if you were writing for a community newsletter,\nyou would choose local examples, whereas if your venue was a Web site for parents, you might choose examples\nthat are more universal.\n\nAudiences tend to be interested in messages that relate to their interests, needs, goals, and motivations.\nDemographic traits can give us insight into our audience and allow for an audience-centered approach to your\nassignment that will make you a more effective communicator (Beebe, 1997).\n\nImproving Your Perceptions of Your AudienceImproving Your Perceptions of Your Audience\n\nThe better you can understand your audience, the better you can tailor your communications to reach them. To\nunderstand them, a key step is to perceive clearly who they are, what they are interested in, what they need,\nand what motivates them. This ability to perceive is important with audience members from distinct groups,\ngenerations, and even cultures. William Seiler and Melissa Beall offer us six ways to improve our perceptions,\nand therefore improve our communication, particularly in public speaking; they are listed in Table 3.3 \u201cPerceptual\nStrategies for Success\u201d.\n\n90 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/10\/3.4.0.jpg\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/wp-content\/uploads\/sites\/22\/2015\/10\/3.4.0.jpg\nhttps:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/telstar\/6149335\/\n\n\nTable 3.3 Perceptual Strategies for Success\n\nPerceptual Strategy Explanation\n\nBecome an active\nperceiver\n\nWe need to actively seek out as much information as possible. Placing yourself in the new culture, group, or\nco-culture can often expand your understanding.\n\nRecognize each person\u2019s\nunique frame of\nreference\n\nWe all perceive the world differently. Recognize that even though you may interact with two people from the\nsame culture, they are individuals with their own set of experiences, values, and interests.\n\nRecognize that people,\nobjects, and situations\nchange\n\nThe world is changing and so are we. Recognizing that people and cultures, like communication process itself,\nare dynamic and ever changing can improve your intercultural communication.\n\nBecome aware of the\nrole perceptions play in\ncommunication\n\nAs we explored in Chapter 2 \u201cDelivering Your Message\u201d, perception is an important aspect of the\ncommunication process. By understanding that our perceptions are not the only ones possible can limit\nethnocentrism and improve intercultural communication.\n\nKeep an open mind The adage \u201cA mind is like a parachute\u2014it works best when open\u201d holds true. Being open to differences canimprove intercultural communication.\n\nCheck your perceptions By learning to observe, and acknowledging our own perceptions, we can avoid assumptions, expand ourunderstanding, and improve our ability to communicate across cultures.\n\nFairness in CommunicationFairness in Communication\n\nFinally, consider that your audience has several expectations of you. No doubt you have sat through a speech or\nclassroom lecture where you asked yourself, \u201cWhy should I listen?\u201d You have probably been assigned to read a\ndocument or chapter and found yourself wondering, \u201cWhat does this have to do with me?\u201d These questions are\nnormal and natural for audiences, but people seldom actually state these questions in so many words or say them\nout loud.\n\nIn a report on intercultural communication, V. Lynn Tyler offers us some insight into these audience expectations,\nwhich can be summarized as the need to be fair to your audience. One key fairness principle is reciprocity,\nor a relationship of mutual exchange and interdependence. Reciprocity has four main components: mutuality,\nnonjudgmentalism, honesty, and respect.\n\nMutuality means that the speaker searches for common ground and understanding with his or her audience,\nestablishing this space and building on it throughout the speech. This involves examining viewpoints other\nthan your own and taking steps to insure the speech integrates an inclusive, accessible format rather than an\nethnocentric one.\n\nNonjudgmentalism involves willingness to examine diverse ideas and viewpoints. A nonjudgmental\ncommunicator is open-minded, and able to accept ideas that may be strongly opposed to his or her own beliefs\nand values.\n\nAnother aspect of fairness in communication is honesty: stating the truth as you perceive it. When you\ncommunicate honestly, you provide supporting and clarifying information and give credit to the sources where\nyou obtained the information. In addition, if there is significant evidence opposing your viewpoint, you\nacknowledge this and avoid concealing it from your audience.\n\nFinally, fairness involves respect for the audience and individual members\u2014recognizing that each person has\n\n3.4 GETTING TO KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE \u2022 91\n\nhttp:\/\/open.lib.umn.edu\/businesscommunication\/chapter\/2-chapter-introduction\/#mclean-ch02\n\n\nbasic rights and is worthy of courtesy. Consider these expectations of fairness when designing your message and\nyou will more thoroughly engage your audience.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nTo better understand your audience, learn about their demographic traits, such as age, gender, and\nemployment status, as these help determine their interests, needs, and goals. In addition, become aware of\nyour perceptions and theirs, and practice fairness in your communications.\n\nExercises\n\n1. List at least three demographic traits that apply to you. How does belonging to these demographic\ngroups influence your perceptions and priorities? Share your thoughts with your classmates.\n\n2. Think of two ways to learn more about your audience. Investigate them and share your findings\nwith your classmates.\n\n3. Think of a new group you have joined, or a new activity you have become involved in. Did the\nactivity or group have an influence on your perceptions? Explain the effects to your classmates.\n\n4. When you started a new job or joined a new group, to some extent you learned a new language.\nPlease think of at least three words that outsiders would not know and share them with the class and\nprovide examples.\n\nReferencesReferences\n\nBeebe, S.

Explain the importance of becoming an active listener and reader.\n\nAs the popular author and Hollywood entrepreneur Wilson Mizner said, \u201cA good listener is not only popular\neverywhere, but after a while he knows something.\u201d Learning to listen to your conversational partner, customer,\nsupplier, or supervisor is an important part of business communication. Too often, instead of listening we mentally\nrehearse what we want to say. Similarly, when we read, we are often trying to multitask and therefore cannot read\nwith full attention. Inattentive listening or reading can cause us to miss much of what the speaker is sharing with\nus.\n\nCommunication involves the sharing and understanding of meaning. To fully share and understand, practice active\nlistening and reading so that you are fully attentive, fully present in the moment of interaction. Pay attention to\nboth the actual words and for other clues to meaning, such as tone of voice or writing style. Look for opportunities\nfor clarification and feedback when the time comes for you to respond, not before.\n\nActive Listening and ReadingActive Listening and Reading\n\nYou\u2019ve probably experienced the odd sensation of driving somewhere and, having arrived, have realized you don\u2019t\nremember driving. Your mind may have been filled with other issues and you drove on autopilot. It\u2019s dangerous\nwhen you drive like that, and it is dangerous in communication. Choosing to listen or read attentively takes effort.\nPeople communicate with words, expressions, and even in silence, and your attention to them will make you\na better communicator. From discussions on improving customer service to retaining customers in challenging\neconomic times, the importance of listening comes up frequently as a success strategy.\n\nHere are some tips to facilitate active listening and reading:\n\n\u2022 Maintain eye contact with the speaker; if reading, keep your eyes on the page.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t interrupt; if reading, don\u2019t multitask.\n\n\u2022 Focus your attention on the message, not your internal monologue.\n\n93\n\n\n\n\u2022 Restate the message in your own words and ask if you understood correctly.\n\n\u2022 Ask clarifying questions to communicate interest and gain insight.\n\nWhen the Going Gets ToughWhen the Going Gets Tough\n\nOur previous tips will serve you well in daily interactions, but suppose you have an especially difficult subject to\ndiscuss, or you receive a written document delivering bad news. In a difficult situation like this, it is worth taking\nextra effort to create an environment and context that will facilitate positive communication.\n\nHere are some tips that may be helpful:\n\n\u2022 Set aside a special time. To have a difficult conversation or read bad news, set aside a special time when\nyou will not be disturbed. Close the door and turn off the TV, music player, and instant messaging client.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t interrupt. Keep silent while you let the other person \u201cspeak his piece.\u201d If you are reading, make an\neffort to understand and digest the news without mental interruptions.\n\n\u2022 Be nonjudgmental. Receive the message without judgment or criticism. Set aside your opinions, attitudes,\nand beliefs.\n\n\u2022 Be accepting. Be open to the message being communicated, realizing that acceptance does not necessarily\nmean you agree with what is being said.\n\n\u2022 Take turns. Wait until it is your turn to respond, and then measure your response in proportion to the\nmessage that was delivered to you. Reciprocal turn-taking allows each person have his say.\n\n\u2022 Acknowledge. Let the other person know that you have listened to the message or read it attentively.\n\n\u2022 Understand. Be certain that you understand what your partner is saying. If you don\u2019t understand, ask for\nclarification. Restate the message in your own words.\n\n\u2022 Keep your cool. Speak your truth without blaming. A calm tone will help prevent the conflict from\nescalating. Use \u201cI\u201d statements (e.g., \u201cI felt concerned when I learned that my department is going to have a\nlayoff\u201d) rather than \u201cyou\u201d statements (e.g., \u201cyou want to get rid of some of our best people\u201d).\n\nFinally, recognize that mutual respect and understanding are built one conversation at a time. Trust is difficult to\ngain and easy to lose. Be patient and keep the channels of communication open, as a solution may develop slowly\nover the course of many small interactions. Recognize that it is more valuable to maintain the relationship over\nthe long term than to \u201cwin\u201d in an individual transaction.\n\nKey Takeaway\n\nPart of being an effective communicator is learning to receive messages from others through active\nlistening and reading.\n\n94 \u2022 BUSINESS COMMUNICATION FOR SUCCESS\n\n\n\nExercises\n\n1. Pair up with a classmate and do a role-play exercise in which one person tries to deliver a message\nwhile the other person multitasks and interrupts. Then try it again while the listener practices active\nlistening. How do the two communication experiences compare? Discuss your findings.\n\n2. Select a news article and practice active reading by reading the article and summarizing each of its\nmain points in your own words. Write a letter to the editor commenting on the article\u2014you don\u2019t\nhave to send it, but you may if you wish.\n\n3. In a half-hour period of time, see if you can count how many times you are interrupted. Share and\ncompare with your classmates.\n\n3.5 LISTENING AND READING FOR UNDERSTANDING \u2022 95\n\n\n\n3.6 Additional Resources\n\nExplore the Web site of the National Association for Self-Esteem. http:\/\/www.self-esteem-nase.org\n\nForum Network offers a wealth of audio and video files of speeches on various topics.

Because this ability to communicate can \nbe traced to the very beginnings of civilized society, committing an idea to writing \u2013 or to video and \nother presentation media \u2013 is a task that is today nearly as automatic as breathing. Unfortunately, taking \ncare to craft the message for positive results is a skill that isn\u2019t as automatic. \n\nEssentially, we have communicated for the same reasons throughout recorded history. We seek to \ndocument, persuade, inform, criticize, educate, inspire, ridicule, evaluate, analyze, entertain, satirize and \nempathize. The tools available to us and the number of people we can reach today make it easy to reach \nout with a quick opinion or quip. Technology increases the number of messages we can send; however, \nit becomes all the more necessary to think through the communication process before pressing the send \nbutton. This is especially true when we communicate on behalf of an organization as an employee or \ncontractor. \n\n1.1 The Backdrop\n\nAdvances in technology and scientific understanding spawn models that help us envision what is \nhappening in a given process. In that sense, a model represents the parts and the whole of a process at the \nsame time. Claude Shannon, a researcher and mathematician at Bell Labs, developed a communication \nmodel in 1947. His model diagramming the communication process included the information source, \nmessage encoder, transmitter, signal, channel, message decoder, receiver, and noise. Warren Weaver later \nadded the concept of feedback to the model, turning it from a strictly linear process to a circular one, \nso that it more closely represented interpersonal communication when it was published in 1949 (The \nShannon-Weaver Model Defined). \n\nFeedback Loop\n\nChannel\nSender\n\nMessage\nEncoded\n\nNoise\n\n              Receiver \nMessage \nDecoded\n\n Figure 1: The author\u2019s reinterpretation of the Shannon-Weaver Model. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n10 \n\nFrom Sumer to Social Media\n\nTo understand how an interpersonal communication model applies to a business situation, let\u2019s say \nyou are the sender, and you write a business process for a new position in your department. You start \nby determining the format of the document, turning to other recently completed business processes as \nan example. This decision to use a pre-set format is your way of encoding the message, along with the \ntone, word choice and detail you use when writing. You are taking your ideas and adapting them to \nan already-accepted document style to present it in a way that the receiver will understand. The next \ndecision is how to present the information. \n\nWhen you choose between publishing it through your company\u2019s intranet and introducing it in segments \nin a Power Point presentation, you are determining the information channel best suited to your \ndocuments. Before the receiver \u2013 a Human Resources manager in this example \u2013 can fully understand \nthe information, she must decode it. \n\nThe Shannon-Weaver model has a few obvious drawbacks when we try to adapt it to organizational \ncommunication. To more accurately represent reality, the model must be given further context. In other \nwords, what factors in the organization influence the communication choices and methods used by its \nemployees? Do a company\u2019s hierarchy and corporate culture affect communication? Within the field \nof communication theory, answers to these questions have been discussed for a century (\u201cAttraction-\nSelection-Attrition Framework\u201d).\n\n1.2 The Theorists\n\nOne theory goes beyond the physical environment and states that the employees themselves determine \nbehavior and, hence, key aspects of communication within their organization. Benjamin Schneider, in his \narticle \u201cThe People Make the Place,\u201d published in Personnel Psychology, made a case for the \u201cAttraction-\nSelection-Attrition\u201d theory (1987). \n\n\u2022\t Personality and interests lead us to our chosen profession.\n\u2022\t Organizations select employees who have common traits.\n\u2022\t Those individuals who do not fit into the company\u2019s environment usually leave. \n\u2022\t They are replaced by others who reinforce the common attributes.\n\nIn companies where employees become too much alike, achieving change may be more difficult. In his \nbook Diffusion of Innovations, Everett Rogers describes how each innovation \u2013 which could be a new \nproduct or practice in a company \u2013 goes through four stages: creating or inventing, communicating the \ninvention, acceptance over time, and the consequences of adopting (or not adopting) the new idea or \nproduct. Further, Rogers identifies five levels of \u201cadopters\u201d which follow a standard bell curve.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n11 \n\nFrom Sumer to Social Media\n\n40.0%\n35.0%\n\n15.0%\n20.0%\n25.0%\n\n10.0%\n  5.0%\n   0.0%\n\n30.0%\n\nInnovators Early\nadopters\n\nEarly\nmajority\n\nLate\nmajority\n\nLaggards\n\nPercentile 2.5% 13.5% 34% 34% 16%\n\nAdoption of Innovations\n\n Figure 2: Everett Rogers defined five levels in the process of adopting innovations.\n\nTo bring this idea down to earth, imagine that you are responsible for introducing a new online tool to \ntrack sales. You have been given a goal of one year to move all of the account executives in your company \nfrom tracking their own activity offline to this new system, which will provide better and more consistent \nmanagement reports. In your role, you become an agent of change and, as you progress through the \nfirst few months, there will be a few account executives who will immediately embrace the new online \ntracking method. Through their quick adoption, they become opinion leaders who can help bring other \nsales staff on board with the innovation. Some will be less willing to change, and still others will require \nrepeated attempts through emails and presentations before they adopt the online sales tracking system.\n\nHow well you perform your task to meet your goal will depend upon how well you design your initial \ncommunication, how rigorously you follow up, and how successful you are at responding to the concerns \nof those who have reservations about adopting a new process. Your role as a change agent requires you \nto modify your message and begin to communicate possible consequences to those who lag behind the \nmajority of sales staff in accepting the new practice. \n\nWhat is an innovation? Any practice, product or service perceived by an employee to be new.\n\nWhat influences employees to adopt change? Interpersonal relationships, opinions of others, and the medium \nchosen to communicate the innovation.\n\n1.3 Creating a Better Model\n\nIn light of the insights from organizational communication studies and real-world situations such as the one \nmentioned in the last section, the Shannon-Weaver model should be modified. Creating a better model requires \nthat we not only understand the context in which communication occurs, but that we also pay attention to \nthe type of message being sent and the chosen channel. In the case of the change agent described in Section \n1.2, this employee will reach out to account executives many times with a different focus in each message. The \nchange agent must also be prepared to work with groups that are at different points in the adoption process \nthroughout the year. Here is an example of the communication tactics for the new sales tracker: \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n12 \n\nFrom Sumer to Social Media\n\n\u2022\t Conduct meetings to introduce concept and timetable for adoption\n\u2022\t Train sales staff in person or by conference call and screen sharing\n\u2022\t Report to management on rate of adoption \n\u2022\t Follow-up with sales staff lagging behind in adoption \n\u2022\t Offer incentives for adoption and involve management in meetings\n\u2022\t Seek feedback from account executives who are using the new process\n\u2022\t Analyze results and establish best practices for future process changes\n\nAn accurate depiction of communication within a company should be dynamic, showing that the sender \nswitches places with the receiver. The messages should be based on common experiences to improve \ncomprehension \u2013 or message decoding. All communication within the company, whether verbal or \nwritten, is always conducted within the context of the existing organizational structure. The components \nof that structure include everything from available technology to accepted etiquette. Also factoring in \nhow communication occurs is whether the company has a hierarchical or horizontal structure.\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\nOrganizational Structure\n\n   Sender\n\nReceiver\n\nReceiver\n\n   Sender\n\nCommon Experience\n\nCommon Experience\n\nMessage\n\nEncoded\n\nMessage\n\nEncoded\n\nMessage\n\nDecoded\n\nMessage\n\nDecoded\n\nChannel\n\nChannel\n\nNo\nise\n\nNo\nise\n\n Figure 3: The author proposes a business communication model.\n\n1.4 Communication Barriers\n\nIronically, factors that could positively influence organizational communication may also lead to noise \nthat impedes efforts to get a message across. Although employees participating in meetings will have a \npre-defined number of shared, common experiences, pitfalls can still occur. When planning a presentation \nor writing instructions for a business process, keep in mind that barriers to communication can be \nexternal to the participants, intrapersonal, or interpersonal (Pearce et al. 1984). \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n13 \n\nFrom Sumer to Social Media\n\n1.4.1 Barriers caused by structure\n\nIf a company has a hierarchical structure, there may be limitations placed on an employee\u2019s ability to manage an \nentire project. There tends to be more management involvement in the process and less leeway to freely reach \nacross groups up and down the organization. In contrast, a more horizontal structure allows an employee to step \nup, assume responsibility for a project, and communicate unimpeded to all groups and individuals involved. \n\nThe availability of technology used to conduct a meeting, and how well that technology functions, could \nalso contribute to or detract from a planned presentation. Nearly everyone has had the experience at one \ntime or another of having a video conference interrupted by technical difficulties. Perhaps you were trying \nto demonstrate a new software product and the test site goes down just when you were ready to begin. \nLuckily, if we are prepared, we can overcome barriers such as these by going to \u201cPlan B\u201d and demonstrate \nfeatures through an alternate Power Point presentation or through screen shots captured earlier.\n\n1.4.2 Intrapersonal hindrances \n\nIntrapersonal factors that hinder effective communication can be traced to the personality, knowledge \nlevel and even to the emotional state of the message sender. An objective self-assessment can help a \nbusiness communicator overcome these hurdles and modify both the tone of the message and the \napproach. If the presenter says, \u201cI am the expert,\u201d directly or through tone and body language, her \naudience will not feel free to raise questions or seek clarification of the material. If the same presenter \nsays instead \u201cI have knowledge to share,\u201d she invites feedback and a healthy exchange of ideas.\n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nwww.discovermitas.com\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/9da50518-808b-41b3-9e08-9fe200fbad87\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n14 \n\nFrom Sumer to Social Media\n\n1.4.3 Interpersonal obstacles\n\nHow will the sender be received by the audience? Is the speaker credible? In a situation where he is \ncommunicating to audience members with a higher rank or status, he may experience a credibility gap. \nThe sender can overcome perceptual factors that block effective communication by objectively assessing \nhow best to frame the message. If his words and body language say, \u201cYou must follow these instructions,\u201d \nhe will invite scrutiny and questions about his authority. The remedy is to say, instead, \u201cI am giving you \nthese instructions so that we can accomplish management\u2019s goals.\u201d This latter approach communicates \nthe concept of teamwork and eliminates emotional undertones.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, communication is most effective when we are able to disassociate \nourselves from the message, to keep the presentation or email or process documentation as objective as \npossible. Is there a connection between the type of message and the channel, or medium, chosen? Generally \nspeaking, the more impersonal the communication, the least effective and most efficient the medium will \nbe. Conversely, the more personal the communication, the more effective and least efficient the medium \nwill be (Timm and Jones, 1983). Let\u2019s look at four examples of common communication channels. \n\nmost e\ufffdcient, \n east e\ufffdective\n\nmost e\ufffdective, \nleast e\ufffdcient\n\nmass email \n\ncover letter \nwith detailed \ninstructions \n\nattached\n\nsmall \ngroup\n\npresentation\nface-to-face\n\nmeeting\n\n Figure 4: The efficiency and effectiveness of a message can be plotted along a sliding scale.\n\nThe challenge for the message sender is to correctly judge the importance of the message in order to \nmaximize both effectiveness and efficiency. Obviously, the receiver has the greatest opportunity to provide \nfeedback and have questions answered in the face-to-face meeting. Are you introducing a new idea or \npractice? If so, choose a channel that will allow you to actively listen to the concerns and questions \nraised by the participants. A small group presentation with a question and answer segment built into the \nagenda serves to dispel misunderstandings and clarify expectations. After the new practice is in place, \na less personal follow-up email to update group members will be appropriate. \n\nFive Common Types of Communication Barriers\n\nOrganizational structure: hierarchy vs. horizontal, available technology\nIntrapersonal factors: personality, level of knowledge and emotional state\n\nInterpersonal factors: perceived credibility of sender by the receiver\nChannel choice: match the medium to the message goals\n\nLack of feedback: Sender depends on feedback to judge success of communication\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n15 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\n2 Understanding Semantic Noise\nSemantics, according to the Encarta English Dictionary, is the \u201cstudy of meaning in language.\u201d Semanticists \nalso analyze the use of symbols and logic in language. Because effective communication depends on the \nsender and receiver sharing the same meaning, semantic noise \u2013 missteps in the process \u2013 must be kept \nto the minimum. We express opinions, beliefs, attitudes and values both directly and indirectly through \nthe language we use. Unfortunately, when we are not aware of how our predispositions filter the messages \nwe send and the messages we receive, semantic noise can send a communication plan into a tailspin. \n\nWhile it is virtually impossible to step outside of the experiences that inform our values and attitudes, \nunderstanding the nature of semantic noise will help us recognize when it occurs in a business setting \nand take precautions to avoid it. Becoming an objective, intentional communicator who knows how \nand when to invoke the appropriate type of message at the right time requires a little time spent on the \nsubject of linguistics. After all, language use is inextricably related to effective communication.\n\n2.1 The role of linguistics\n\nAll languages are comprised of sounds that make up words, and the words are then pronounced in a \nstructure that is used either formally or informally within society. Because these sounds evolved differently \nfrom culture to culture, they have been arbitrarily assigned by native speakers to symbolize a thing or \nan idea. The more abstract the symbolic representation, the more imprecise the meaning and the greater \nthe chance that the speaker and the audience may assign a different meaning to the abstraction. \n\nEven within the same language words undergo semantic change over time. A given word may refer to \none type of thing and then become generalized to represent other things that are similar. The product \nbrand name Kleenex has undergone such a meaning change and now the name is used by many when \nreferring to any light, disposable, rectangular product that is applied to the nose. Conversely, a word \nmay start out as a general description of something and, over time, refer only to a specific thing. For \nexample, the word starve once meant to die. Today the word has a more specific meaning, which is to \ndie of hunger (Fromkin & Rodman, 1973). \n\nThe meaning of words also shifts over time. In their book, An Introduction to Language, Victoria Fromkin \nand Robert Rodman trace the meaning of several words from Old English to Middle English and to \ncurrent times. To be silly meant to be happy in Old English. In Middle English the word meant to be \nnaive. Today, silly means foolish, according to the Encarta Dictionary. However, according the online \nUrban Dictionary, it means to be funny in a cute or weird way. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n16 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\nPopular culture and technology contribute new words to the English language each year. In 2012, for \ninstance, the dictionary publishers at Merriam-Webster added 15 words or word combinations, including \ncloud computing, game changer, energy drink and aha moment. In business, each industry develops its \nown vernacular. Managers in a high-tech firm may use the word \u201cinterface\u201d to mean \u201ca communication.\u201d \nNeeding to \u201cshut down\u201d or have \u201cdown time\u201d is to take a break from work. One employee may ask \nanother person to \u201cping\u201d her with an update, instead of saying to a co-worker, \u201cSend me another email \nwhen you know more.\u201d \n\nThese words become a type of shorthand to quickly get a message across to those who work with \nus in the same company. Expressions \u2013 and even acronyms \u2013 that develop within a company serve \nto separate the language used internally from that used to communicate to external audiences. In a \nmulti-national company, each geographical area may use company-wide expressions and add their \nown regionally adopted words and phrases to internal messages and presentations. Such specialized \nwords with understanding limited to one group within an organization can become a hindrance when \ncommunicating across geographical regions. \n\nwww.job.oticon.dk\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/0e9efd82-96d7-e011-adca-22a08ed629e5\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n17 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\n2.2 Chomsky\u2019s Contributions\n\nNoam Chomsky, one of the best-known names in the field of linguistics, developed the concept of \nuniversal grammar. Early in his studies, he observed that children all over the world, regardless of the \nlanguage they will eventually speak, go through the same acquisition process. The ease at which children \nlearn to speak and apply the rules of grammar along the way led Chomsky to conclude that humans \npossess an innate ability to speak that is independent of \u201cintelligence, motivation, and emotional state\u201d \n(Chomsky, 1965). The complexities of grammar make acquisition all the more amazing. Chomsky \nconcluded that there is \u201c\u2026little hope that much of the structure of the language can be learned by an \norganism initially uninformed as to its general character\u2026.\u201d (Chomsky, 1965)\n\nMore recently, Chomsky proposed a minimalist approach to the study of language, which requires the \nlinguist to ask and answer basic questions, resulting in a deeper understanding about the nature of \nlanguage. In a 2012 lecture, he started with the question, \u201cWhat is language?\u201d and followed up with \nother queries about how the concepts, principles and results inform the investigation into acquisition \nand use. He still held that language acquisition is generated internally, a process he called i-language. \n\nIf the capacity for language is hard-wired into the brain, it is easy to see how we can take our \ncommunication skills for granted and remain unaware of how our words will be construed. You\u2019ve \nheard the phrase, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you say. It\u2019s how you say it.\u201d How a sentence is delivered is a major clue \nto its meaning. Emphasizing one word over another in a sentence changes both the tone and meaning \nof a statement. For example the question, \u201cWhat time did you arrive this morning?\u201d signifies authority, \nbut when asked in another way, \u201cWhat time did you arrive this morning?\u201d it denotes teasing or sarcasm. \n\nChoice of language in a business setting will vary depending upon the formality, or informality, of a \ngiven situation. However, both the spoken presentation and the handouts should be created to match \nthe occasion. If you use overly complex language in a small group training session, the result may be \noff-putting and demotivate the participants from asking questions and providing feedback. In addition to \nanalyzing the situational requirements of communication, it is equally important to consider the audience. \nHow many charts and graphs will you present? How critical is each one to getting across your message? \n\n2.3 S.I. Hayakawa\u2019s Contributions\n\nS.I. Hayakawa, who was a semanticist and teacher, wrote about the nature of language as it relates to \nthought and behavior. One of Hayakawa\u2019s central assumptions in his book, Language in Thought and \nAction, was that \u201c\u2026when the use of language results, as it so often does, in the creation of aggravation \nof disagreements, and conflicts, there is something linguistically wrong with the speaker, the listener, or \nboth.\u201d (Hayakawa, 1964) What are some of the errors that lead to semantic noise?\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n18 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\n\u2022\t Don\u2019t confuse the word with the thing it names. Words are merely the agreed-upon \nsymbolic representations of a person, place, thing, idea, or animal. The person is not the \nsame as the title he holds in a company. The title is a way of describing the work he does or \nthe organizational level at which that work is accomplished.\n\n\u2022\t Does the map match the territory? When we hold onto information that has no basis in \nfact, the map (information) does not match the territory (our world as it factually exists). \nA rumor in the workplace is an example of information that doesn\u2019t match the territory. \nManagement must address rumors before they become detrimental to productivity or are \nleaked to the media as fact.\n\n\u2022\t Understand the differences among reporting, inferring and judging. A report is a factual \naccount of an event, or a first-person observation. An inference is a comment about \nsomething that is not known based on something known. She is buying two sandwiches \n(known), so she must be really hungry (inferred). Are we making an incorrect inference? \nMaybe she is buying a sandwich for a friend. A judgment is a statement of disapproval \nor approval of an event, of a person, or of objects. When in a meeting, look critically at \nthe reports and identify when an inference is being presented as a fact. Watch your own \ninclinations, too. Recognizing when we are reporting, inferring and judging helps us to \nthink critically. \n\nHayakawa also discussed how the use of abstractions can lead to empty, nonsensical statements. As an \nexample, \u201cManagement should drive productivity.\u201d But what does it mean to drive productivity? What \nconstitutes productivity, and where are we driving it? Without an operational definition of the words or \nfurther clarification at the very least, we are left with a meaningless statement. \n\nTo illustrate how the process of abstracting works, Hayakawa developed the ladder of abstraction and \ngave it eight levels. Level one is an object, person or thing. It is something we can point to, that has \nconcrete reality. As we move up the ladder of abstraction, we move farther away from the specific and \ntowards a high-level concept that has little to do with the original level. Figure 5 shows one possible path \nthrough terms and concepts, beginning with a person and moving up to the highest level of abstraction, \nwhich is productivity in this case.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n19 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\nperson\n\n employee\n\nKaitlin\n\n team member\n\ncompetitve advantage\n\nworkforce\n\nproductivity\n\nsoftware designer\n\n1\n\n3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n5\n\n7\n\n8\n\n Figure 5: The author applies Hayakawa\u2019s ladder of abstraction to an example in business.\n\nEffective verbal and written communication shouldn\u2019t necessarily be free of abstractions, but use them \nin conjunction with descriptive language to explain and support the more complex and less concrete \nwords and phrases. If you have attended a meeting that was only full of detail without any generalized \nstatements, I\u2019m sure that you found it tedious and boring. On the other hand, a presentation that is only \ngeneralities and abstractions with no specifics is confusing and meaningless. Meetings are not the place \nto leave meaning up to interpretation, especially when the objective is to share information to achieve \nindividual or team goals on behalf of a company.\n\n2.4 Exploring the concept of shared meaning\n\nIn an organization, when we communicate with one another within the framework of shared experience, \nwe have a built-in benefit that the messages we send and receive will also have shared meaning. Without \nshared meaning, all the time spent to perfect a presentation, revise meeting notes, or send out an agenda \nwill be wasted. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n20 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\nHow do we derive meaning from words? The context in which we hear a word gives us clues to the \nword\u2019s meaning. We pick up on contextual clues all the time, especially when we are learning a new skill. \nHowever, if the trainer has prepared the session objectively and with a critical eye, she will have edited \nher material to include definitions, descriptions and examples. \n\nAs long as the words in a sentence are arranged in the expected order, which is at the very basic a subject-\nverb-object sequence, we believe that we should be able to understand the intended meaning. Granted, \nin a field that is unfamiliar, we may need to look up one or more of the terms. From a semantics point \nof view, though, there are words that belong together and words that just do not work in combination. \nThe following sentence is an example often quoted by linguists to illustrate how words that appear in the \ncorrect grammatical order may not make sense when used in the same sentence: Colorless green ideas \nsleep furiously (Chomsky, 1957). This sentence contains words that directly conflict with one another. \nSomething cannot be colorless and green. Although the image of ideas sleeping sounds rather compelling, \nthe adverb furiously modifying the verb sleep makes no sense.\n\nAnother example of words that fit together structurally but cannot be understood by the reader is the \n\u201cJabberwocky\u201d by Lewis Carroll, which is a masterful assemblage of nonsense words. Here are the first \nfour stanzas of the poem:\n\nAutomotive Lighting Jihlava, kariera@al-lighting.com, +420 567 562 450, www.al-lighting.cz\n\nAutomotive Lighting Jihlava\nMember of Magneti Marelli a Fiat group,\np\u0159edn\u00ed v\u00fdrobce sv\u011bteln\u00e9 automobilov\u00e9 techniky posiluje sv\u016fj t\u00fdm o \nabsolventy a studenty elektrotechniky a dal\u0161\u00edch technick\u00fdch obor\u016f.\n\nZaj\u00edm\u00e1 T\u011b\u2026\n\u2022\t Mo\u017enost pod\u00edlet se na designu a v\u00fdrob\u011b \n\n\u0161pi\u010dkov\u00fdch produkt\u016f\n\u2022\t Pr\u00e1ce s modern\u00edmi technologiemi \n\u2022\t P\u0159\u00edle\u017eitost osobn\u00edho a kari\u00e9rn\u00edho r\u016fstu \n\nNab\u00edz\u00edme pracovn\u00ed p\u0159\u00edle\u017eitosti pro absolventy, \nst\u00e1\u017eisty a trainee programy\n\n\u2026pak  hled\u00e1me pr\u00e1v\u011b Tebe.\n\nwww.al-lighting.cz\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/a8b0753c-78d5-4419-b54f-a18000d9e7cc\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n21 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\n\u2018Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe:\n\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\n\u201cBeware the Jabberwock my son!\nThe jaws that bite, the claws that catch!\n\nBeware the JubJub bird, and shun\nThe fruimious Bandersnatch!\u201d\n\nHe took his vorpal sword in hand:\nLong time the manxome foe he sought-\n\nSo rested he by the Tumtum tree,\nAnd stood awhile in thought.\n\nAnd, as in uffish thought he stood,\nThe Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,\n\nCame whiffling through the tulgey wood,\nAnd burbled as it came!\n\nWhen a co-worker overuses industry acronyms and field-specific terminology in a presentation to a \ngroup from another department, those in attendance may feel as if they have fallen through the rabbit \nhole and landed next to Alice. A business communicator must be able to temper the use of words which \nmay block the attempt to share meaning. Always keep in mind why the presentation is necessary, who \nwill be attending, and what industry or special knowledge \u2013 if any \u2013 the audience brings to the meeting. \n\n2.5 Beyond the sound bite\n\nAn overabundance of information coming at us in a myriad of forms competing for our attention has \ngiven rise to the phenomenon of the sound bite. This terse, short little phrase often repeated ad infinitum \nbecomes part of our cultural lexicon over time. The sound bite proliferates in the political and media \nrealms. Organizations, though, are not immune from the tendency to infuse internal communication \nwith short phrases and slogans. As is true with advertising messages, these internal slogans will have a \nhigher degree of symbolic meaning that is light on the information value and heavy on the connotations \nconjured by the phrase.\n\nSome Business Sound Bites \n\nWe have an open-door policy.\nPractice the three P\u2019s: Punctuality, performance and progress.\n\nIn e-commerce, cash is king.\nWatch the bottom line.\n\nAlways arrive eager and ready to work.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n22 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\nSound bites can be no more than another form of semantic noise that fails to share meaning. Or, when \nused correctly as a part of an internal communication campaign, these same messages may become \neffective. Again, context, description and examples make the difference in whether a message is successful \nor not. When taken as a single message, each one of the sound bites listed above creates more questions \nthan if they had remained unsaid. What is the backstory behind each sound bite? What do these sound \nbites actually say about the company\u2019s management? \n\n\u2022\t Is the first one referring to all managers? Surely, there must be some times that the office \ndoor will be closed. Does an open door mean the same as open communication? \n\n\u2022\t The second example tells us that the speaker believes you cannot perform well or progress \nin your career without being on time for work. Is that the message the company\u2019s managers \nreally want to distribute? Perhaps, but the employees of this company require a more \ncomplete explanation of these expectations.\n\n\u2022\t Beyond the catchy alliteration in the third example, the question remains: King of what? \nThis is not a statement intended to motivate employees, right? What type of cash carries the \nroyal title? Think about the symbolism behind the message: Cash is being elevated to the \nhighest status. At what level does management at this company place employees who help \ngenerate the cash?\n\n\u2022\t We know that the \u201cbottom line\u201d relates to the net profits of a company. If employees are \nasked to \u201cwatch\u201d it, what does management really want them to do? Cut expenses on office \nsupplies and expense reports, or merely read the financial reports each quarter?\n\n\u2022\t Here\u2019s a cheerful sound bite. The underlying message seems to be that it is best to keep your \ntroubles at home and look positive and productive, even if you don\u2019t feel like it.\n\nIt may be tempting to have an in house graphic designer work up several posters displaying the latest \nsound bite from the human resource department. As with all messages, it\u2019s best to assess it critically before \ngoing to print. The first step in getting beyond the sound bite is to make sure that the symbolic message \nconveyed by the slogan does not conflict with management\u2019s internal communication goals. Remember \nthat the sound bite is part of a larger process. Use the well-written slogan to headline a complete internal \ncommunication campaign that may include newsletters, paycheck inserts, and videos. \n\n2.6 Listening is an action\n\nAlthough many may think that to listen is to be passive, the human behavior we call listening activates \nboth physiological and psychological mechanisms. The first step is hearing, which requires that a sound \nbe within the range of human hearing. When these audible sounds travel into the ear canal, they resonate \nas vibrations which reach the eardrum and then the middle ear. Because we are surrounding by constant \nnoise, we learn to become selective and pay attention to only those sounds that have meaning for us at \na given time. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n23 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\nSelectivity, though, has a detrimental effect on how we assign meaning to and perceive the sounds. It \ntakes conscious effort to listen objectively and reduce our tendencies to screen and pass judgment on \nthoughts and ideas being presented. By being open to the speaker\u2019s ideas, we allow the information to \nreach us without being blocked or filtered.\n\nPracticing active listening is the best way to show that you are participating in the communication event. \nThink about the ideas being proposed. Analyze the facts, ask questions and seek clarification from the \npresenter. Make sure you understand how the disparate points relate to one another. Take your thoughts \nabout the presentation one step farther: Ask yourself how you can use the ideas to help you in your \nwork (Pearce, et al, 1984). \n\nWhat are the characteristics of a good listener? According to Carol M. Lehman and Debbie D. DuFrene, \nwho wrote the textbook Business Communication, those who practice active listening tend to be well \nliked and effectively share messages with supervisors, which leads to improved work performance. \nA supervisor who is a good listener is more likely to have employees who have a high degree of job \nsatisfaction (Lehman and DuFrene, 1999). \n\nBy 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet\u2019s \nelectricity needs. Already today, SKF\u2019s innovative know-\nhow is crucial to running a large proportion of the \nworld\u2019s wind turbines. \n\nUp to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-\nnance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our \nsystems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic \nlubrication. We help make it more economical to create \ncleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. \n\nBy sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, \nindustries can boost performance beyond expectations. \n\nTherefore we need the best employees who can \nmeet this challenge!\n\nThe Power of Knowledge Engineering\n\nBrain power\n\nPlug into The Power of Knowledge Engineering. \nVisit us at www.skf.com\/knowledge\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/0d9efd82-96d7-e011-adca-22a08ed629e5\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n24 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\n2.7 Recognizing non-verbal cues\n\nHow a message is delivered conveys more meaning than the psychological act of perceiving and processing \nthe words alone. The body language of the speaker, her tone of voice, and the way she pronounces some \nsyllables with more inflection than others are all cues the listener uses to figure out what the speaker \nactually means. Do the inflections and gestures emphasize her message or conflict with what she is saying? \nCertain gestures carry a message that the speaker may not want to send. Studying non-verbal signals \nand what they may portray can raise the awareness of both the speaker and the audience members. \n\n\u2022\t Laughing lightly during a speech may mean the speaker is nervous, or it could mean that he \ndoesn\u2019t expect to be taken seriously.\n\n\u2022\t A manager who sits beside a visitor instead of remaining behind the desk shows that she \nwants to speak informally or that she wants to speak at the same level and put the visitor at \nease.\n\n\u2022\t A person who states that face-to-face communication is important while not making eye \ncontact confuses the person receiving this message by giving conflicting signals.\n\n\u2022\t A presenter who taps the desk or podium while talking will find the audience listening more \nto the distracting noise than to the presentation.\n\n2.8 Examples in business\n\nWhen unaddressed, semantic noise becomes detrimental to interpersonal relationships and, by association, \nnegatively influences work output. The business situations introduced in the previous sections presented \nspecific examples of semantic noise. In the workplace interpersonal communication is much more subtle \nand complex. A single interaction, when we understand the context of the relationship between two \npeople, reveals more than one type of noise serving to impede the participants\u2019 ability to share meaning.\n\nWhat happens when two workers interact based on a different set of maps of the same territory? If you \nhave witnessed a conversation where two people are talking at, or past, each other instead of speaking \nwith one another, you will hear the resulting semantic noise. In the two scenarios that follow, the stage \nwill be set so that you can understand what set of facts and assumptions each communicator brings to the \ninteraction. The types of noises involved will be identified and a remedy to improve future interactions \nwill be suggested.\n\nIn the last section of this chapter, examples of semantic noise created when presentations are either too \ngeneral or too specific will be examined. The remedy, an appropriate mixture of abstractions and details, \nwill be suggested.\n\n2.8.1 The division president\u2019s assistant and the operations analyst\n\nSetting: The interaction takes place at the corporate headquarters of a mortgage lender.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n25 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\nFacts and assumptions made by the president\u2019s assistant: She believes that by virtue of her title, she \nmust take charge to keep all administrative activities running smoothly in the department. She takes \non an informal role of managing others below the rank of vice president, even though there is no \nacknowledgment of her responsibility to do so through an official organizational chart.\n\nFacts and assumptions made by operations analyst: Although he works well in a team environment \nwhen collaborating on projects, he only respects the formal reporting relationships when it comes to \ntasks and situations outside of normal job boundaries. \n\nType of Noise: Interpersonal barrier\n\nInteraction: The president\u2019s assistant announces a surprise fire drill. However, no alarms are sounding. \nShe steps swiftly up to the operations analyst\u2019s cubicle, saying, \u201cI need you to leave your desk \u2013 right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the middle of a project,\u201d he responds. He is startled, defensive and feeling under pressure to \nfinish updating his database design.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. Listen. I need you to leave now. It\u2019s a fire drill.\u201d She clearly enunciates each syllable and \nlowers her tone slightly before moving quickly on to the next cubicle.\n\nwww.cpost.jobs.cz\nwww.ceskaposta.cz\n\nM\u00e1\u0161 znalosti z IT, logistick\u00fdch nebo ekonomick\u00fdch obor\u016f?

The assistant\u2019s manager has a responsibility to \nclearly establish whether the unofficial supervisory role should be recognized by all of the employees in \nthe department. If not, then the assistant needs to be set straight regarding how she addresses her fellow \nworkers. Either way, all parties involved should be operating with the same set of instructions to reduce \nor eliminate the interpersonal barriers to effective communication.\n\n2.8.2 The reluctant Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and the accounts payable (AP) manager\n\nSetting: This second interaction occurs at the office of a family owned online retailer.\n\nFacts and assumptions made by CFO: She is a co-owner, but she works part-time. Although the business \nis small, she believes that all salaried employees should work more than eight hours every day. She also \nbelieves that she knows how long it takes to complete each task in the accounting department and holds \nthe one employee she supervisors \u2013 the AP manager \u2013 to a strict list of tasks. The CFO expects the AP \nmanager to send a report by email at the each of each week with the dates each item was completed. She \nthinks in hierarchical terms about work duties even though there are only 10 employees in the entire \ncompany.\n\nFacts and assumptions made by the AP manager: She is used to working independently but finds the \nincreasing work load difficult to handle with only one part-time accounting clerk to supervise. The AP \nmanager has implemented procedures to streamline AP tasks. However, increasing business puts strains \non the resources, and she doesn\u2019t think the CFO is willing to help. Consequently, she has been taking \nwork home to keep up with the demands. She comes up with a new idea to ease the workload, but it \nwill take some time to develop. She doesn\u2019t feel that the extra work she has been putting in is noticed \nor appreciated.\n\nType of Noise: Interpersonal barrier; confusing reporting, inferring and judgment\n\nInteraction: The AP manager walks into the CFO\u2019s office. \u201cI have a new idea to make the AP process \nmore efficient. I\u2019d like to talk to you about it.\u201d\n\nThe CFO picks up the last week\u2019s task list from her desk and shakes it at the AP manager. \u201cHow can I \napprove a new project when you can\u2019t get the required work done each week?\u201d \n\nRemedy: Which person\u2019s map doesn\u2019t fit the territory? In this case, both participants are working with \ninformation that does not match reality. The CFO has confused a valid comprehensive report of duties \nwith the arbitrary task list and has made incorrect inferences that the AP manager is not getting her \nwork done. Furthermore, she is making judgments without having all the facts available to make a \nsound decision about the workload imbalance in her department. The AP manager expects the owner\u2019s \nsupport but doesn\u2019t get it. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n27 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\nBoth participants need to come up with a task list for the department that represents the actual work \nbeing done. The AP manager should let the CFO know how long it takes to complete the projects on the \nlist. The CFO and AP manager should then assign priorities that are reasonable and achievable. If more \nhelp is needed to accomplish the work, the owners should commit to providing the required support.\n\n2.8.3 Too abstract, too detailed or just right?\n\nIn section 2.3, we discussed appropriate and inappropriate use of abstract and concrete, detailed \nstatements. An exercise in exaggeration further illustrates this concept.

Emotional or judgmental language in the \nworkplace, though, can block communication (Timm and Jones,1983). For example, when stating a \nproblem to be tackled by a team, phrase it so that the problem can be approached objectively and make \nit possible to work toward a solution. It should be clear to the reader that the statement is specific and \nthat it doesn\u2019t presuppose that someone is to blame for the problem. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n30 \n\nUnderstanding Semantic Noise\n\n\u2022\t Poor problem statement: Hourly workers abuse overtime.\n\u2022\t Improved problem statement: Find out why workers are spending more than eight hours \n\nper day on assigned tasks.

A \ncompany\u2019s intranet may feature announcements about changes in benefits and provide a list of e-learning \nopportunities. Newsletters cover new hires, volunteer activities and may even feature an article about \nemployees who attended a recent conference. What about the lesser-known activities carried out by \nproject teams and other groups within a company? These groups will also use the available intra-company \nchannels to reach an audience. \n\nFormal and informal groups may form for a number of reasons. One may be to plan a holiday luncheon \nor an awards banquet. Whether a group is functional or not will depend on who the individual members \nare, what each can contribute, and whether the goal is actually realistic. Teams, on the other hand, form \nspecifically to solve a business problem or create a method to address a particular challenge. However, \nthe communication process the team goes through as the individuals work together toward a defined \ngoal warrants a closer look. \n\nOne hindrance to an effective group process is what organizational communication researchers call \n\u201cgroupthink\u201d (Timm and Jones, 1983). If the members are not equally engaged in the project assigned \nto their group, it is likely that one or two individuals will tend to dominate conversations and make the \ndecisions. The other members go along out of indifference or because they feel intimidated. A group \nthat is project centered requires that its members contribute specialized skills and is less susceptible to \ngroupthink. \n\n3.1 Project teams\n\nEmployees with specialized skills often serve on project teams, which vary in size, meeting frequency and \nproject length. Studies have shown that size and group purpose are factors that have a major influence on \nhow the team members will interact (Pearce, et al, 1984). Because project teams are formed to advance \nthe goals of the organization, individuals may already know one another and be accustomed to working \ntogether. A natural leader may emerge during the first few meetings, or a leader may already be appointed \ndue to her job title and level of responsibility.\n\n3.1.1 Understanding Group Dynamics\n\nAll of the communication barriers that occur in interpersonal relationships also apply to group \ncommunication. However, how well a group performs will depend upon the structure of the group, the \npersonalities of the individual members, the perceived status of each person, and whether the group has \nenough cohesion to successfully complete the projects. The behavior of the individuals will also influence \nthe entire group and the ability to stay on task.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n32 \n\nInternal Communications\n\nFactors Affecting Group Performance\n\nStructure\nSize\n\nPersonalities of members\nPurpose\n\nStatus of members\nMembers\u2019 behavior\n\nIs the group is structured like a committee, with the opinions and input from each member carrying the \nsame weight? Not much is accomplished without a leader to move the group onward in discussion and \nproject plans. It is not easy to reach consensus and time is wasted trying to make decisions \u201cby committee.\u201d \nOn the other hand, is the team leader viewed as authoritarian and controlling, one who leaves little \nroom for input toward how the project will be completed? Such an atmosphere squelches feedback and \nfoments resentment. The group members are there to take orders and there is no \u201cbuy in\u201d or ownership \nof the project by anyone except the leader. Most groups in organizations fall somewhere between these \ntwo extremes. In fact, a group that is structured with the best attributes of each type focuses on the \nproject, has a designated leader, and members are encouraged to share ideas and contribute solutions.\n\nZA\u010cNI KARI\u00c9RU S N\u00c1MI!\n\n\u0160KODA TRANSPORTATION\n\nStudujete technick\u00e9 obory?

If the project is of short duration and does not involve resources \nacross departments, consider forming a project group of 3 or 5. Some professional communicators suggest \nbuilding a team with an odd number of members to avoid the split decision scenario with equal sides \nadvocating a different position or outcome. A project such as implementing a new accounting program \nin a medium to large company may require one large group that breaks down into smaller components \nto research and test different modules, such as payroll, AP, AR and fixed assets.\n\nPersonality types can both help and hinder team progress. A person who stops the leader or presenter \nat nearly every point with a question unnecessarily prolongs a meeting to the consternation of the other \nmembers. A member who interrupts and rushes ahead to comment on points not yet mentioned may \nconfuse other participants and interfere with the tempo and flow of the meeting. It isn\u2019t necessary to run \neach meeting with strict rules. However, a simple request to \u201chold your questions and comments until \nafter the presentation\u201d will keep the pace even and the interruptions to a minimum.\n\n3.1.2 Establishing your purpose\n\nA team leader\u2019s first order of business is to establish the group\u2019s purpose. Each member should be clear about \nthe expectations of the company\u2019s managers, the anticipated time frame for completing the project, and the \nskills required. By sharing this information, the team members see how they fit into the project plan. Decide \nhow often the group will need to meet. The team leader should establish meeting frequency at the same time \nhe communicates the purpose. Remain flexible as the project unfolds, calling meetings only when necessary. \nFollow these criteria to help determine whether to meet with everyone or meet with members separately.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n34 \n\nInternal Communications\n\n\u2022\t If group members will benefit from a meeting called to share information, schedule it. Will \nthe data and reports presented help everyone on the team to do a better job? \n\n\u2022\t Are the group members you choose to invite an integral part of the project phase currently \nunder review? Will each individual\u2019s skills be required?\n\n\u2022\t Are you assigning new tasks and coordinating individual efforts? Consider meeting with \na subset of the entire group. Follow up with an email to the entire team so that each \nparticipant knows where the project stands.\n\nFor purposes of illustration, let\u2019s say that the project will focus on researching and adopting a new \nsoftware program with modules for the accounting department and sales and marketing. As the leader, \nyou bring together a group with experience in several areas: reviewing, recommending and purchasing \nvendor products; two team members representing the accounting department; and an IT representative \nto coordinate testing and roll out from a systems perspective. Although the initial focus will be on \ncompleting the task, the leader must also work within the group to make sure that all the departments \naffected by the new software program will be advised of the change so that they can plan ahead.\n\n3.1.3 Go! Ready, set?\n\nThe most common communication error witnessed by the author in her 30-plus years of working in \nvarious industries is the phenomenon she calls \u201cGo! Ready, set?\u201d In the enthusiasm and synergy created \nwhen a team functions well as a group, the members fail to take into account how their product or \npractice will affect others outside the group. They happily complete the project and begin rolling out their \ncarefully considered plans only to be shocked and taken aback by the negative, if not hostile, reactions \nto their efforts.\n\nEven a project that culminates in a new service for customers must go through the proper internal \ncommunication channels before it is ready to be released or it is doomed to fail. The \u201cGo!, Ready set?\u201d \nexperience occurs when the team is so focused on the details that they neglect to step back and take a \nlook at the project in terms of the organization\u2019s structure. In the instance of a new service developed \noutside the normal channels and marketed directly to customers by the team, there are stakeholders \nwho should be added to the project group at the beginning. What happens when the sales manager first \nfinds out about the service being offered to his customers when he is copied on the final correspondence \nat the conclusion of the project? The manager may urge his customers to reject the offer. Now you have \ntwo groups in the same organization working against one another.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n35 \n\nInternal Communications\n\nThe project team decided to go without getting ready. The team failed to consider all of the internal \n\u201caudiences\u201d for the new service. Members didn\u2019t get set, either, ignoring representatives from sales and \nmarketing who should have been included at the planning stage. As participants, sales staffers should \nhave been invited to contribute their ideas, expertise, and customer knowledge. Remember, as shown in \nFigure 6, assembling the optimal project team and conducting meetings with an eye toward problem-\nsolving and resolution requires the leader to think conceptually from an organizational communication \nstandpoint at the very outset. Figure 7 diagrams groups directly and indirectly influenced by the team\u2019s \ndecision to roll out a new service to customers. Constructing such a communication diagram also serves \nto identify all of the audiences that need to be aware or involved with the project at various stages. \n\nProject: \nDevelop a product \n\nwarranty \nprogram\n\nAccounting\n \n\nSales    Marketing\n\nLegal\nDepartment\n\nEngineering\n\nWarehouse\nShipping\n\nand\nReceiving\n\n Figure 7: This diagram depicts the interrelationships between project team members  \nand departments affected by both the planning and outcomes of the new warranty program. \n\n3.1.4 Analyzing your audience\n\nThe next step after creating a communication diagram for your project is to determine how involved each \nseparate audience should be and at what point communication should begin with each group. Figure 8 \ntakes the results of Figure 7 and develops a plan for keeping the audience members informed. The plan \nbuilds in a feedback loop so that the project team receives input along the way. Requesting feedback \nfrom departments that are affected by your project but not involved in the details can greatly improve \nthe final project outcome. How? Input reveals potential stumbling blocks that could delay a project. \nFor example, what if the new service requires customers to sign a contract that directly conflicts with \nan existing contract? It would be better to know about the conflicting terminology at the time the new \ncontract is drafted rather than after distribution. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n36 \n\nInternal Communications\n\nDocument warranty program and disseminate\nwith revised contract, including the plan for\ndistributing it to customers.\n\nCreate final communication to customers \nand attach warranty contract.\n\nCustomers, all departmental opinion \nleaders and project team members\n\nAccounting, marketing, warehouse \nshipping and receiving department, \n\nand sales\n\nLegal department, sales, and \nengineeringCreate draft of warranty contract.  \n\n                                   \n Project Step  Audience\n\nMeet with team members to assign tasks, \nschedule meetings, and identify key opinion\nleaders in each department.\n\nProject team members\n\nTeam members present updates.

Is there a secret to capturing the attention of your intended receiver? \nIn most companies, email inboxes overflow with reminders, general correspondence and updates. If there \nis a secret, it involves keeping people apprised of programs and projects that will have a direct impact \non their work. In fact, two of the first questions an employee asks are, \u201cHow does this affect me?\u201d and \n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it for me?\u201d In Figure 9, the communication plan has been augmented by the channels chosen \nto most effectively communicate to each group. \n\nDocument warranty program \nand disseminate with revised \ncontract, including the plan for\ndistributing it to customers.\n\nCreate final communication \nto customers and attach \nwarranty contract.\n\nCustomers, all departmental \nopinion leaders and \nproject team members\n\nAccounting, marketing, warehouse \nshipping and receiving department, \nand sales\n\nLegal department, sales, and \nengineering\n\nCreate draft of warranty contract.  \n\n                                   \n Project Step  Audience\n\nMeet with team members to assign \ntasks, schedule meetings, and identify \nkey opinion leaders in each department.\n\nProject team members\n\nTeam members present updates throughout\nprocess.

Develop one presentation that can be slightly modified for each audience. \nAlthough you are the leader, make sure each team member who represents a key department suggests \ncontent for the basic presentation. Explain the project benefits at the beginning of the presentation. \n\nAvoid oversaturating your audience with too many messages. Schedule the update meetings to coincide \nwith critical stages in project development. Too many emails and meetings about a project work against \nthe team\u2019s objectives. By limiting your communication to important milestones, though, you respect \nthe workload and time commitments of those employees who should be kept informed of your group\u2019s \nprogress. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n38 \n\nInternal Communications\n\n3.1.7 Opinion leaders in the organization\n\nA project team functioning within an organization starts with an idea and finishes with an innovation that, \nif successful, will be integrated into the company\u2019s best practices. Not all innovations are created equally. \nSome projects test and stretch the understanding of what is normal and acceptable within a company. \nOthers are quickly integrated as common sense fixes to existing procedures. The more challenging or \nexpansive the project \u2013 those that have a great impact on a few departments or a wide impact on many \ndepartments \u2013 the more crucial it is to enlist the aid of opinion leaders. \n\nIndividuals who have attained the informal role of opinion leader do so through their \u201c\u2026technical \ncompetence, social accessibility, and conformity to the system\u2019s norms\u201d (Rogers, 2003). In his book, \nDiffusion of Innovations, Everett Rogers also points out that opinion leaders tend to be the innovators \nwho can advocate for change through early adoption. He also states that they are at the \u201ccenter of \ninterpersonal communication networks\u201d (Rogers, 2003).\n\nWhen you develop your communication chart, identify opinion leaders who can help carry your message \nto various groups in the organization. For example, a director of sales who has been with the company for \nseveral years and is well known may be an asset to your project. Get his opinions and recommendations \nalong the way. Whenever your project team needs to seek advice before continuing on to the next step, try \nto contact the manager or analyst who can provide assistance and serve as an advocate for your project.\n\n3.2 Employee communication\n\nMany departments within a company must reach out to employees to share information. The payroll \ndepartment sends the yearly wages and tax statements and advises when requested pre-tax adjustments, \nsuch as 401K contributions, have been changed. The human resources department may oversee the annual \nor semi-annual employee review process. Within operations or sales, training modules may be available \nfor employees through a company Wiki or through an e-learning site located on the organization\u2019s \nintranet. In each instance the messages being sent required planning and prioritizing before they could \nbe deemed ready to publish.\n\nIf you are put in charge of compiling, updating and publishing information about your department, how \nwould you manage the messages? Which process would you go through to determine what to publish \nand what to leave out of an article? The most important step is to decide what you want to say and who \nyou want to reach. Next, use the internal channels that will most efficiently reach your audience. It may \nsound straight forward, but effective employee communication demands planning and proper execution. \n\n\u2022\t General articles that feature a new employee or an event should be placed in the company \nnewsletter or the home page of the intranet.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n39 \n\nInternal Communications\n\n\u2022\t Consider using a Wiki or e-newsletter to inform employees inside and outside of your \ndepartment about accomplishments, projects, or skills needed for jobs that may be open.\n\n\u2022\t Highly technical information and business process documentation can be shared with a \nlimited audience through Share Point or other project-oriented online sites.\n\nIf you are instead responsible for an ongoing campaign to keep employees informed of overall company \nnews along with human interest stories featuring departmental staff, your plan will be much more \ncomprehensive. In addition to taking the steps outlined above, you will need to develop a strategy to \ncarry out the communication objectives and come up with a way to measure results at the conclusion \nof specific stages in the process. \n\nHow effective are the messages? By bringing in a communication consultant, you will receive an answer to \nthat question \u2013 and many others. Reasons for seeking expert assistance range from a desire to take the pulse \nof an already-successful internal campaign to an urgent need to resolve an imminent communication \ncrisis. Consultants conduct a study to determine effective and efficient ways that communication can \nhelp a business reach goals (Holland and Gill, 2001). \n\nNNE and Pharmaplan have joined forces to create \nNNE Pharmaplan, the world\u2019s leading engineering \nand consultancy company focused entirely on the \npharma and biotech industries.\n\nIn\u00e9s Ar\u00e9izaga Esteva (Spain), 25 years old\nEducation: Chemical Engineer\n\nNNE Pharmaplan is the world\u2019s leading engineering and consultancy company \nfocused entirely on the pharma and biotech industries.

But busy as they are, most of my colleagues \nfi nd the time to teach me, and they also trust me. \nEven though it was a bit hard at fi rst, I can feel over \ntime that I am beginning to be taken seriously and \nthat my contribution is appreciated.\n\nTrust and responsibility  \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/9a9dfd82-96d7-e011-adca-22a08ed629e5\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n40 \n\nInternal Communications\n\n3.2.1 How does a communication audit work?\n\nAt the most basic level, an internal communications audit is the process of asking questions of audience \nmembers (management and employees) to find out what they know (disseminated information), how \nthey know it (channels), and how they act upon \u2013 and think about \u2013 the messages. A well-designed \naudit will yield both qualitative and quantitative results, which will then be compiled in a report at the \nconclusion of the study. The final report will also provide suggestions for improving the effectiveness of \nthe messages and the efficiency with which they are delivered.\n\nBecause a communication study may focus on one or many audiences, such as the organization\u2019s \nemployees, customers, or the general public, the analysis of internal communication may be only a \npart of the overall study. Experts in the field advocate having the audit completed by an objective third \nparty instead of relying on the public relations department because, generally, employees will be able \nto speak more freely with someone outside of the company (Holland and Gill, 2001). Additionally, if \norganization\u2019s managers decide to conduct a study without the aid of an outside service, there will be \nan inherent tendency for subjective reasoning to influence the outcome. \n\nLet\u2019s use the example of a consultant hired by Company Z to evaluate its internal communication \nplan. Management\u2019s communication goals include improving employees\u2019 general knowledge about the \ncompany, discrediting rumors and improving morale. Before the consultant begins to gather information, \nshe needs to walk down the ladder of abstraction and come up with questions that can measure whether \nthese goals have been achieved. As the questions are written, the consultant will begin deciding upon the \nmethod to use to collect information from the groups within the organization. Depending upon the size \nof the company and the requirements of the study, she may use focus groups, interviews, and surveys.\n\nWhat is the existing communication culture and how is information currently being shared? The \nconsultant will analyze the internal messages going out to Company Z employees through all available \nchannels. Do the employees communicate upward to management through the existing communication \nprocess? While this question will be answered in part through the interviews and focus groups, the \nconsultant will look for instances of employee feedback or questions asked through internal media.\n\n\u2022\t Intranet\n\u2022\t Company meetings\n\u2022\t Departmental meetings\n\u2022\t Informal group gatherings\n\u2022\t Team meetings\n\u2022\t Wiki\n\u2022\t Email\n\u2022\t Newsletters\n\u2022\t Bulletin boards\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n41 \n\nInternal Communications\n\n\u2022\t Flyers\n\u2022\t Posters\n\u2022\t Brochures\n\n3.2.2 Working toward favorable outcomes\n\nAfter the consultant submits the final report, management and the department in charge of creating and \nexecuting the communication plan \u2013 whether it is the public relations manager or the human resources \ndirector \u2013 must agree on the next steps. In the case of Company Z, the study may recommend that \nmanagers find ways to recognize employee contributions and request input from employees regarding \nprograms, procedures and practices. \n\nIn his article The Root Causes of Low Employee Morale, published online on the American Management \nAssociation\u2019s website, John Schaefer offers five suggestions to managers seeking to improve employee \nattitudes and morale. Each one of the suggestions relates to how a manager communicates with an \nemployee. Heeding Schaefer\u2019s advice, which is paraphrased and expanded below, requires a manger to \nbe open minded and to understand how his or her actions, words and tone affect an employee. \n\n\u2022\t Take the time to create a trusting relationship. As discussed in section 2.1, team leaders and \nmanagers should be as objective as possible when listening to team members or employees \nwho report to them. In a trusting working relationship, semantic noise will be greatly \nreduced.\n\n\u2022\t Respect your employees\u2026and the work will get done. What\u2019s the opposite of respect? \nMicromanagers show a lack of confidence in those who report to them and in their own \nability to manage.\n\n\u2022\t Encourage the creative approach. Listen and guide to foster creative thinking. \n\u2022\t Create teams that function effectively. Refer to Section 3.1.\n\u2022\t Be genuine. Your words and deeds should match. For example, don\u2019t demand that your \n\nemployees work more than 40 hours a week if you aren\u2019t seen consistently doing the same.\n\n3.2.3 An example that worked\n\nAfter managers receive the results of a communications audit or needs assessment, they will begin to \nlook for ways to implement changes to improve both the effectiveness and efficiency of their internal \ncommunication efforts. Case studies published on various Internet websites show that companies make \nimprovements through two main ways: training and technology, not necessarily in that order. Even \nmanagers with good communication skills will benefit from additional training. Technological advances \nin online tools and software that enables employees to share files can lay the foundation for successful \ninternal messaging. The caveat, though, is that success will depend upon how well new methods are \nintegrated into the organization.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n42 \n\nInternal Communications\n\nElite Customer Solutions won the Public Relations Institute of Australia\u2019s 2011 Golden Target Award \nfor Internal Communication. The winning project was submitted in a document titled \u201c\u2019Best in Class\u2019 \nInternal Communication Management through SnapComm\u201d modules, which describes a communication \nenvironment that was too dependent on email messages, which were often deleted by the recipients. The \ncompany\u2019s intranet received little traffic, and communication about projects was not handled consistently. \nThese factors, and the absence of procedures and methods to archive files and documents, created a \nbusiness risk (\u201cBest in Class,\u201d 2011).\n\nAfter conducting a thorough needs analysis, the communication specialist at Elite Customer Solutions \nsought input from key personnel to create and put into effect a system that would address the challenges \nand opportunities revealed by the study. The strategy, as defined in the online document, was to change \nthe communication culture to one where employees easily share information, have direct access to news \nabout what is happening in the company, and make more sound decisions that are commensurate with \nthe objectives of the organization (\u201cBest in Class,\u201d 2011).\n\nDedicated Analytical Solutions\nFOSS\nSlangerupgade 69\n3400 Hiller\u00f8d\nTel. +45 70103370\n\nwww.foss.dk\n\nThe Family owned FOSS group is \n\nthe world leader as supplier of \n\ndedicated, high-tech analytical \n\nsolutions which measure and \n\ncontrol the quality and produc-\n\ntion of agricultural, food, phar-\n\nmaceutical and chemical produ-\n\ncts.

Training and support were provided so that employees could get up \nto speed on the four new messaging modules: a channel to alert employees of news via a screensaver; a \nchannel for internal news stories; a channel to survey and assess employees\u2019 knowledge; and a channel \nthat allowed employees to interact through a forum, a blog, and a help desk. For Elite Customer \nSolutions, new technology together with a well-executed training and support program solved the \ninternal communication issues, addressed the challenges, and removed the risks (\u201cBest in Class,\u201d 2011).\n\n3.3 Business process documentation\n\nOnce the project team has successfully implemented a new practice or process, business tasks will \nundoubtedly change. Perhaps the project requires that new positions be created in support of the \ninnovation as it moves into the integration phase. Beyond the job description, actual business procedures \nshould be documented and kept up to date. Such documentation, once drafted, analyzed, and revised, \nbecomes the record of best practices for the position. \n\nDo the steps in the process succeed in reflecting the objectives of the original project team? Let\u2019s return to \nthe example of the online tool discussed in Section 1.2 which was to be designed for account executives \nto record their sales. A database administrator is needed to grant access and run reports. The account \nexecutives will need to know who to contact and how to reach the administrator, who should also be \navailable to answer technical questions. Documentation must be written in such a way that anyone with \nthe required skills could assume responsibility for the position by following the steps outlined in the text.\n\nThe business process documentation may be called Standard Operating Procedures in some companies \nor Best Practices in other organizations. Regardless of the name, well-written documentation stands on \nits own at the pinnacle of communication excellence. To reach that state, the document must be highly \ndetailed, extensively reviewed and analyzed, and revised until it is ready to be published.\n\n3.3.1 Document in detail\n\nImagine that you have been asked to write instructions for accessing a website and sending an email \nthrough the \u201ccontact me\u201d page. These tasks may be so well ingrained in your daily routine that you really \ndon\u2019t give much thought to the steps involved. Now try to break down each phase of the process without \nleaving anything out. Think about describing the steps to someone who doesn\u2019t even use a computer. You \nwill have to include screen shots to illustrate your instructions. How do you know you have succeeded \nin documenting the tasks? Ask a friend or relative to sit down in front of a laptop and try to follow \nyour instructions. If that person has to ask you questions, then your instructions are not clear enough. \n\nOf course, business processes are much more complex than the directions for navigating to a website \nand sending an email. It is the complexity and the degree to which you know your own job that makes \nproperly documenting each step in a given procedure particularly challenging. The first draft is often \nrife with omissions and ambiguity. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n44 \n\nInternal Communications\n\n3.3.2 Review and analyze\n\nEnlisting the help of another person in your department to walk through the steps will help you zero \nin on the areas that can benefit from expanding, clarifying and writing good, concrete instructions. Try \nto choose someone who is not familiar with the procedures you are describing. If you can, watch while \nyour co-worker tests your instructions. As you observe, note the questions asked and the steps you may \nhave missed.\n\nAnother method of reviewing business documentation is to go over the instructions during a conference \ncall. If you use MS Live Meeting, the screen sharing can be captured and recorded for later review. \nWhen you watch the video after the meeting, compare it to the written instructions. Do the screen shots \nmatch your documentation? Use the feedback you receive from this exercise to make improvements. Be \ncognizant of the fact that, depending upon the complexity, it is not unusual to test and revise more than \nonce before you arrive at a finished product.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd#$%\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd&'())%\ufffd*+\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd-\n\n.\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n The Wake\nthe only emission we want to leave behind\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/4ba133ea-6153-46a2-ad8f-9fef00f222a0\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n45 \n\nExternal Communication\n\n4 External Communication\nExternal communication embodies all of the audiences \u2013 or publics \u2013 reached through an organization\u2019s \nmarketing, governmental relations and community involvement programs. Business communicators in \neach of these fields have some of the same challenges faced by the internal communications manager \nand project team leader, except on a grander scale. They will need to look at the types of messages being \nsent by the company and assess how closely the messages are aligned with the organization\u2019s objectives. \n\nCompany \nX\n\nCustomers \nand Suppliers\n\nCommunity \n(virtual and physical)\n\nGovernmental and\nIndustry Regulators\n\n Figure 10: Company X communicates with these audiences.\n\nThe above diagram offers one way to view the key publics for Company X. Note that some messages \nintended for the regulating audience may also be relevant to the online community. For example, let\u2019s \nsay that Company X uses green technology to operate a manufacturing plant. While there may be \ntax advantages, the reduction in the organization\u2019s carbon footprint positively affects the surrounding \ncommunity. In this instance, the business communicators within finance and community relations may \nwork together on the messaging.\n\n4.1 Marketing communication\n\nBecause the marketing department is responsible for sales, promotion, branding, pricing, competitive \nanalysis, and distribution, each segment will play an important role in the marketing communication \nefforts. Just as the communication audit and needs assessment uncover opportunities in the realm of \ninternal communication, a similar evaluation should be completed at the conclusion of each marketing \ncampaign, with an emphasis on measuring the results of the marketing messages These are just a few \nof the questions to be answered in order to find out how well a marketing communication campaign \nperformed: \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n46 \n\nExternal Communication\n\n\u2022\t Were the communication objectives of the campaign met?\n\u2022\t How would you describe the customers who purchased products or services during the last \n\ncampaign? Who were they and what are their demographics?\n\u2022\t Did the company\u2019s messages motivate or influences the customers? \n\u2022\t What factors determined or contributed to the customer\u2019s attitude toward the company and \n\nits products or services? \n\u2022\t What do they buy, and how often are the purchases made? \n\u2022\t If creating brand loyalty was a desired outcome, how did the campaign increase your \n\ncustomers\u2019 loyalty to your brand? \n\n4.1.1 Writing an actionable plan\n\nThink about the marketing communication plan as a separate section within the company\u2019s overall \nmarketing plan. However, the communication segment can also stand alone because it covers analysis, \nstrategy and implementation \u2013 three fundamental components of an actionable plan. Imbedded in the \nanalysis of target markets, products, price, distribution and promotion will be advertising and public \nrelations campaigns, working together and designed to implement the marketing strategy. Data gleaned \nfrom placing prior campaigns under the analytical microscope provide a road map to follow. Within \nthe map will be clues to the proper mix of channel and message that will achieve results for a particular \nproduct or service. \n\nWhen writing an actionable plan, set objectives, determine the type of messages that will be created to \nmeet those objectives, and figure out the best media for the message. For example, one objective may \nbe to increase the percentage of visitors to your web site who purchase your products. Now, let\u2019s say \nyour marketing research points out that those visitors who are directed to your site from certain online \nsearch marketing channels \u2013 or pay-per-click sites \u2013 tend to buy at a higher rate than visitors who access \nyour website through other means. After analyzing the advertising messages that worked well in the \npast, you decide to write an ad to appear in the highest-performing marketing search channels in order \nto increase your conversion ratio. \n\nYou can maximize reach by using channels that give the company and its products both a virtual and \nphysical presence. Consider demonstrating products through webinars and videos along with trade \nshows or in-store events. Run a contest to introduce new products and promote the contest through \nsocial media and the company\u2019s website. Some other common approaches to sales promotion involve \nspecial deal pricing and a program that rewards customers for their loyalty. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n47 \n\nExternal Communication\n\nThink about how best to execute the public relations portion of the marketing plan. What type of messages \nand vehicles will get the most coverage for a new product line? What is the most effective approach to \ncreating a customer and community awareness campaign featuring a company\u2019s commitment to solar \nenergy? The organization\u2019s core values should be reflected in its marketing communications plan, and \nthe plan should grow out of and support the stated company goals and objectives.\n\nHow will the marketing communication plan be implemented? Define the tactics that will be used to \nreach the objectives identified in the strategy section. These are the specific steps to be taken, how much \neach will cost, when the advertising or messages are scheduled to appear and how results will be tracked. \nThe more specific your implementation steps, the better you will be able to measure effectiveness. \n\nWhat are the hallmarks of an actionable plan?\n\nAnalysis\nStrategy\n\nImplementation\nMeasurement\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/7df08111-c180-4bd8-97db-a2d500e6043a\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nBusiness Communication: Achieving Results\n\n48 \n\nExternal Communication\n\n4.1.2 Coordinating messages\n\nPerhaps there are multiple writers in the marketing department who each represent a specialty. In \na medium-sized or large company, it is not unusual to have several staff members contribute to a \nmarketing communication plan. However, it is advisable that the specialists in each area come together \nin a project team so that there is both cohesion and continuity in the final plan. The team approach gives \neach member an opportunity to learn from others, which can strengthen the relationship between the \ndisparate messages and help to coordinate them in an overall strategy. In the instance of a new product \nline launch, the team could choose to schedule and coordinate the following messages:\n\n\u2022\t Send one or more news release to trade publications online and in print\n\u2022\t Create and post messages on social media channels\n\u2022\t Write blog articles \n\u2022\t Conduct an email campaign \n\u2022\t Advertising on search marketing sites\n\u2022\t Create product spec sheets that visitors can download from the web site\n\u2022\t Publish articles about the products online and in print\n\n4.1.3 Getting the timing right\n\nWhen planning multiple campaigns and designating a time frame for execution, the marketing team \nshould realize that good timing is essential.

The study \nfound that oral and written communication skills were important in predicting job success, as was the \nability to communicate well with others in the workplace. \n\nA University of Pittsburgh study found that the most \nimportant factor in selecting managers is communication \nskills.\n\nThis makes sense when you think about it. If you can communicate well, you can get your message across \nto others in an effective way and they then have accurate instructions to complete their assigned tasks. \nIf you are not able to communicate well, the messages you send get lost in translation. Communication \nbreakdowns result in barriers against your ability to develop both professionally and personally. \n\nEven though communications skills are so important to success in the workplace, there are many \nindividuals who find these skills to be a stumbling block to their progress. They struggle to convey their \nthoughts and ideas in an accurate manner, making it difficult to progress and nearly impossible to lead well. \n\nHowever, there is hope for anyone who finds communicating to be difficult. These skills can be practiced \nand learned. It takes learning about how communication works, how to communicate exactly what it is \nyou want to say, what mode of communication is best, and what factors are influencing the ability for \nyou to send and receive messages with acumen. \n\n1.2 What Is Communication? \n\nWhen asked to define communication, how would you respond? Most people will relate to the forms of \ncommunication \u2013 talking or listening. But communication goes beyond that. Communication involves \ngetting information from one person to the other person. Yet even this is not a complete definition \nbecause communicating effectively involves having that information relayed while retaining the same \nin content and context. If I tell you one thing and you hear another, have I communicated? \n\nCommunication is the art and process of creating \nand sharing ideas. Effective communication depends \non the richness of those ideas.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n9 \n\nIntroduction \u2013 Effective Communication Skills\n\nSo if we look at communication from another angle, it involves the perception of the information as \nmuch as the delivery of that information. In other words, we can define communication as the art and \nprocess of creating and sharing ideas. Effective communication depends on the richness of those ideas. \nIn order to be effective at communicating, there are a number of skills that you can rely. Which skill you \nchoose will depend upon your situation, the recipient of your communication, and the information that you \nneed to convey. \n\n1.3 What Are Communication Skills? \n\nImagine you are on one side of a wall and the person you want to communicate with is on the other side \nof the wall. But there\u2019s more than the wall in the way. The wall is surrounded by a moat that is filled with \ncrocodiles and edged by quicksand. These barriers could be things like different cultures, different expectations, \ndifferent experiences, different perspectives, or different communication styles, to name just a few. \n\nCommunication skills are the tools that we use to remove \nthe barriers to effective communication.\n\nYou might experience only one of these barriers at a time, or you might find yourself facing them all. \nGetting your message to the other person requires that you recognize these barriers exist between you, \nand that you then apply the proper tools, or communication skills, to remove those barriers preventing \nyour message from getting through. \n\nOf course, communication is a two-way street. The person on the other side of those barriers will also \ntry to send messages back to you. Your ability to understand them clearly could be left to a dependence \non their ability to use communication skills. But that\u2019s leaving the success of the communication to chance. \nInstead, you can also use your own communication skills to ensure that you receive messages clearly as well. \n\nFinally, there isn\u2019t only one point in your communication with another person at which you have to \nwatch out for barriers. To be successful at communicating, it\u2019s important to recognize that these barriers \nto communication can occur at multiple points in the communication process. \n\n1.4 The Communication Process\n\nThe communication process involves multiple parts and stages. These are: \n\nThe communication process is composed of several stages, each \nof which offers potential barriers to successful communication.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n10 \n\nIntroduction \u2013 Effective Communication Skills\n\n\u2022\t Source \n\u2022\t Message\n\u2022\t Encoding\n\u2022\t Channel\n\u2022\t Decoding\n\u2022\t Receiver\n\u2022\t Feedback \n\u2022\t Context\n\nAt each of these stages, there is the potential for barriers to be formed or problems to arise. As we look \nat ways to limit the barriers to communicating effectively, remember that you may have to apply them at \nmore than one occasion during your communications process. The steps in the process are represented \nin Figure 1 and explained further in the following information. \n\n Figure 1: The Communication Process\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n11 \n\nIntroduction \u2013 Effective Communication Skills\n\n1.4.1 Source\n\nThe source of the communication is the sender, or for our purposes, you. In order to be a good source, \nyou need to be clear about the message that you are sending. Do you know exactly what it is that you \nwant to communicate? You\u2019ll also want to be sure you know why it is that you are communicating. What \nresult is it that you expect? If you cannot answer these questions, you will be starting the communication \nprocess with a high chance of failure.\n\nThe source of the message is the sender. The sender \nmust know why the communication is necessary and \nwhat result is needed.\n\n1.4.2 Message \n\nThe message is simply the information that you want to communicate. Without a message, there is no \ncause for communicating. If you cannot summarize the information that you need to share, you aren\u2019t \nready to begin the process of communication. \n\nThe source of the message is the sender. The sender \nmust know why the communication is necessary and \nwhat result is needed.\n\nwww.liu.se\/master\n\nStudy at Link\u00f6ping University\nand get the competitive edge!\nInterested in Computer Science and connected fields?

It\u2019s sort of like how messages are sent via a fax. The information on the paper has to be \nencoded, or prepared, before it can be sent to the other party. It has to be sent in a format that the other \nparty has the ability to decode or the message will not be delivered. \n\nIn order to encode a message properly, you have to think about what the other person will need in order \nto understand, or decode, the message. Are you sharing all the information that is necessary to get the full \npicture? Have you made assumptions that may not be correct? Are you using the best form of sending it in \norder to ensure the best chance of the message being properly received? Are there cultural, environmental, \nor language differences between you and the other party that could cause miscommunication? \n\nEncoding is the process of taking your message and \ntransferring it into the proper format for sharing it \nwith your audience. It requires knowing your audience \nand ensuring that your message provides all of the \ninformation that they need.\n\nOf course, to encode a message properly, you have to know who your audience is. You need to have an \nunderstanding of what they know and what they need to know in order to send a complete message. \nYou need to use language they will understand and a context that is familiar. One simple example of how \nyou can do this is being sure to spell out acronyms. We sometimes forget that not everyone is familiar \nwith the acronyms that we may use on a regular basis. \n\n1.4.4 Channel\n\nThe channel is the method or methods that you use to convey your message. The type of message you \nhave will help to determine the channel that you should use. Channels include face-to-face conversations, \ntelephone calls or videoconferences, and written communication like emails and memos. \n\nThe Channel is the method of communication that you \nchoose such as face-to-face, by telephone, or via email.\n\nEach channel has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, you will find it difficult to give complex, \ntechnical information or instructions by using just the telephone. Or you may get bad results if you try \nto give criticism via email. \n\n1.4.5 Decoding\n\nDecoding happens when you receive the message that has been sent. The communication skills required \nto decode a message successfully include the ability to read and comprehend, listen actively, or ask \nclarifying questions when needed. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n13 \n\nIntroduction \u2013 Effective Communication Skills\n\nDecoding is the process of receiving the message \naccurately and requires that your audience has the means \nto understand the information you are sharing.\n\nIf the person you are attempting to communicate with seems to be lacking the skills to decode your \nmessage, you will need to either resend it in a different way or assist them in understanding it by supplying \nclarifying information. \n\n1.4.6 Receiver\n\nSince you have thought out your message, you\u2019ve certainly also thought about what you want the desired \nresult to be on the part of your listener. But it\u2019s important to realize that each person that receives your \nmessage will be listening to it through their own individual expectations, opinions, and perspectives. \nTheir individual experiences will influence how your message is received. \n\nYou have expectations for a response from the \nreceiver when you send a message. You can increase \nthe chances of getting this result by addressing your \naudience\u2019s concerns or addressing specific benefits as \npart of your communication.\n\nWhile you can\u2019t always address each person\u2019s individual concerns in a message, part of planning for your \ncommunication is to think ahead of time about what some of their thoughts or experiences might be. \nFor example, if you are releasing a new product and want to convince customers to try it, you would \nwant to be certain to address the specific benefits to the customer, or what improvements have been \nmade since the last version was released. \n\n1.4.7 Feedback \n\nNo matter what channel you have used to convey your message, you can use feedback to help determine \nhow successful your communication was. If you are face-to-face with your audience, you can read body \nlanguage and ask questions to ensure understanding. If you have communicated via writing, you can \ngauge the success of your communication by the response that you get or by seeing if the result you \nwanted is delivered. \n\nFeedback lets you gauge how successful you were at \ncommunicating. It also offers a chance to adjust your \ncommunication process for the future.\n\nIn any case, feedback is invaluable for helping you to improve your communication skills. You can learn \nwhat worked well and what didn\u2019t so that you can be even more efficient the next time you communicate \nwith that person or the next time you need to communicate a similar message. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n14 \n\nIntroduction \u2013 Effective Communication Skills\n\n1.4.8 Context \n\nThe context is the situation in which you are communicating. It involves the environment that you are \nin and that in which your audience is in, the culture of your organization(s), and elements such as the \nrelationship between you and your audience. You communication process will not look the same when \nyou are communicating with your boss as it will when you are communicating with a friend. The context \nhelps determine the tone and style of your communication. \n\nContext involves things such as your relationship with \nyour audience, the culture of your organization and your \ngeneral environment.\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\n\r\r\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\r\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\t\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\r\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\r\t\ufffd\t\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\r\t\r\ufffd\n\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\n\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/bda1fd82-96d7-e011-adca-22a08ed629e5\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n15 \n\nPerspectives in Communication\n\n2 Perspectives in Communication \n2.1 Introduction \n\nWe all come to each communication exchange with our own \u2018filter\u2019 through which we see the world, the \nperson we are communicating with, and the situation or topic we are communicating about. These filters \nmean that we don\u2019t always start with the same perspective as the person we are communicating with. \n\nOur individual perceptions are the \u2018filter\u2019 through which \nwe communicate with others.\n\n2.2 Visual Perception \n\nThese filters can be visual, as in the famous example in Figure 2. What do you see when you look at the \npicture? A young woman or an old crone? Both perspectives are possible, and both are valid. \n\n Figure 2: Young Woman & Crone\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n16 \n\nPerspectives in Communication\n\n Figure 3: The Two Perspectives\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n17 \n\nPerspectives in Communication\n\nFigure 3 reveals the two perspectives. Both of the perspectives represented in the young and old woman \nare valid \u2013 they are simply two different ways of seeing the same thing. We cannot decide that one does \nnot exist just because we don\u2019t see it. We have to recognize that there is more than one way to perceive \nthe picture, just like there is usually more than one way to see any situation we encounter. \n\n2.3 Language \n\nThe different perspectives we experience can be with language as well. How many times have you received \nan email that seemed to have a certain \u2018tone to it,\u2019 and that perception of tone colored the way that you \nmight have responded? \n\nThe same words can have very different meanings depending \non how we interpret them.\n\nHere\u2019s another example. What is the meaning of the following phrase? \n\nA woman without her man is nothing\n\nSounds pretty bad at first glance, doesn\u2019t it? Look again. If you add punctuation or change the word \nemphasis, how does the meaning change? \n\nA woman. Without her, man is nothing.\n\nStudy in Sweden -  \ncloSe collaboration \nwith future employerS\nM\u00e4lardalen university collaborates with \nMany eMployers such as abb, volvo and \nericsson\n\nwelcome to \nour world\nof teaching!\ninnovation, flat hierarchies  \nand open-Minded professors\n\ndebajyoti nag  \nsweden, and particularly \n\nMdh, has a very iMpres-\nsive reputation in the field \nof eMbedded systeMs re-\nsearch, and the course \n\ndesign is very close to the \nindustry requireMents.\n\nhe\u2019ll tell you all about it and  \nanswer your questions at  \n\nmduStudent.com\n\ntaKe the\nright tracK\ngive your career a headStart at m\u00e4lardalen univerSity\nwww.mdh.se\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/34717038-4c1a-4f12-9146-a1860097a253\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n18 \n\nPerspectives in Communication\n\nThe words were the same in both cases. But the meaning has now changed completely. So although we \nthink our meaning may be clear when we use specific words in a certain order, we can\u2019t always be certain \nthat the other person will read or hear them in that way. \n\n2.4 Other Factors Affecting Our Perspective\n\nThere are a multitude of other factors that can affect our perspective, thereby affecting how we \ncommunicate with another person. Some of these factors come from our past experiences, our prejudices, \nour feelings, and our environment. Some of these will be discussed in greater detail in later chapters. \n\n2.4.1 Past Experiences \n\nImagine that you are in a meeting where you will be discussing changes in your personnel policies at \nwork. What will you be bringing to that conversation? You might have examples of other company\u2019s \npersonnel policies. You might have examples from your own time in the company that demonstrate why \nyou feel that certain changes might need to be made. Or you might come to the table empty-handed, \nwith just a pad of paper and a pen in order to take notes. \n\nWhat influences you to do any of these things? Your past experience. You would bring outside information \nbecause you have learned in the past that comparing situations can be helpful in decision making. You \nbring examples of your own experience because you have learned in the past that examples can be \npowerful ways to make your case. Or you come to the table empty-handed because in the past you have \nfelt that your input wasn\u2019t valued or you have no past experience in this topic and so you are a \u2018clean \nslate\u2019 information wise. \n\nIn every one of these situations, your communication is being affected by your past experience. You \nenter a situation, a meeting, or a conversation, with certain expectations of what will happen in that \nscenario, and you behave accordingly. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n19 \n\nPerspectives in Communication\n\nOf course, sometimes you want your past experience to influence your future communications. For \nexample, when your team responded positively to the sales tactics you put in place, those same or similar \ntactics can certainly be successful again. \n\nIt\u2019s when our negative past experiences stifle our communication or alter our full potential for \ncommunicating that we need to be aware. Further examples of how your past experience could influence \nyour communication are given in Figure 4. Note that not all of them are negative \u2013 our past experiences \ncan reaffirm our communication as well. \n\n2.4.2 Prejudices\n\nWe all have prejudices. They occur when we take our past experiences with a person and assume that \nthe same type of experience will happen with all people who are similar to the first. Prejudices are partly \ndue to culture and partly due to personal preference or experience. Not all prejudices involve a negative \ncharacteristic either; for example, you could consider all of one group to be smart. \n\nPast Experience Resulting Effect on Communication\n\nYour boss has reacted negatively when you have discussed \nthis topic in the past\n\nYou hesitate to discuss the topic even when it is \nnecessary for your work\n\nYour co-worker has forgotten important information \nmultiple times in the past\n\nYou assume he or she will forget the information this \ntime and so you overload him or her with reminders\n\nYour boss ignored your idea in the last meeting You don\u2019t bring up another idea that could have made \nan impact \n\nYou got nervous the last time you gave a presentation You start out even more nervous on your next \npresentation\n\nThe group reacted well to your last sales pitch You use a similar style for your next sales pitch \n\nThe last twenty customers rejected your new product You fail to offer that product to the 21st customer and \nbeyond, some of whom may have wanted the product\n\nThe last email you received from a colleague was rude (you \nperceived it as rude!) \n\nYou send a rude email in return \n\nYour subordinate was disagreeable the last time you asked \nhim to work overtime\n\nYou don\u2019t ask him this time, even though he would \nhave agreed\n\nFigure 4: Past Experiences Influencing Communication \n\nThe problem with prejudices is when they start to influence how or to whom we communicate. To get an \nidea of how this could be happening in your workplace, consider how you might complete the phrases \nbelow. If you can\u2019t think of a way to complete it from your own experience, complete each phrase with \na stereotype that you might have heard in the past: \n\n\u2022\t Women in the workplace are\u2026.\n\u2022\t Young people in the workplace are\u2026\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n20 \n\nPerspectives in Communication\n\n\u2022\t Seniors in the workplace are\u2026\n\u2022\t Working mothers in the workplace are\u2026\n\u2022\t Supervisors at work are\u2026\n\u2022\t The lowest job level workers are\u2026\n\u2022\t Blacks, whites, or (fill in a race) in the workplace are\u2026\n\u2022\t Homosexuals in the workplace are\u2026.\n\u2022\t Christians, Muslims, or (fill in a religion) in the workplace are\u2026\n\u2022\t Disabled people in the workplace are\u2026\n\nPrejudices occur when we take an isolated experience \nwith one \u2018type\u2019 of person and then act as if all encounters \nin the future with people of the same \u2018type\u2019 or with the \nsame characteristics will result in the same experience.\n\nWhen we categorize people like this, we eliminate their individuality. If you are communicating to a \nperson through a perceived prejudice or stereotype, at the very least you are greatly limiting the chances \nof your communication being successful or producing the desired result. At the most, you are alienating \nor insulting someone with whom you are trying to build a working relationship. \n\nDevelop the tools we need for Life Science\nMasters Degree in Bioinformatics\n\nBioinformatics is the  \nexciting field where biology, \ncomputer science, and  \nmathematics meet.  \n\nWe solve problems from \nbiology and medicine using \nmethods and tools from  \ncomputer science and  \nmathematics.\n\nRead more about this and our other international masters degree programmes at www.uu.se\/master\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/b6a1fd82-96d7-e011-adca-22a08ed629e5\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n21 \n\nPerspectives in Communication\n\nYour goal should be to see each person as an individual that is separate from any preconceived notions \nyou might have about them. It takes practice, but wouldn\u2019t you like to be seen and communicated with \nas an individual and not as a sum of different labels that can be placed on you? \n\n2.4.3 Feelings\n\nFor this area of influence, there are actually two ways in which your feelings can influence your \ncommunication with another person. The first simply refers to the way that you feel on a given day; if \nyou feel well, you\u2019ll communicate in one way and if you feel ill you\u2019ll communicate in another. Since \nyour well being fluctuates, it makes sense that the way you communicate will change somewhat with \nhow well you are feeling. If you find yourself experiencing difficulty in communicating due to an illness \nor other physical stressor, recognizing and acknowledging it, when appropriate, can be very helpful \nwhen others might interpret the change in your communication as having something to do with them. \n\nThe second aspect related to feelings refers to how you feel about a specific person. When you genuinely \nlike someone, the way you communicate is going to show it. Unfortunately, the same can be said for when \nyou don\u2019t like someone. However, as you continue learning about effective communication skills in the \nfollowing chapters, you will find some tools to help you be as effective as possible in communicating, \neven when it\u2019s with someone that you dislike. \n\n2.4.4 Environment \n\nThe last area of influence on your communication is your environment. All of us communicate differently \nin different environments. This is simple enough to observe in everyday life. Do you speak to your \ncolleagues the same way that you do to your friends? Do you talk to strangers with more or less formality \nthan people you know well? Do you talk to your subordinates the same way when your own boss is there \nas you do when she is not there? As you go through your workday, notice how where you are, what is \ngoing on and who else is present may be impacting the way that you communicate. \n\nRecognizing how the environment might be affecting others you communicate with is a skill that can come \nin handy for you, particularly when you perceive that the environment is having a negative impact on your \nability to communicate effectively with someone. This skill will help you to perceive why someone might be \ncommunicating in the way that they are. It will also give you a factor that you can alter in order to make the \nperson more comfortable or to establish a level of formality that you feel is important in a particular situation. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n22 \n\nElements of Communication\n\n3 Elements of Communication \n3.1 Introduction\n\nWhat does it take to communicate with another person? How are we communicating even when we \naren\u2019t using words? When you begin studying communication, you\u2019ll find that we communicate with \nmuch more than our words. In face-to-face communication, our words are only part of the message. \n\nThe balance of the message, and in fact, the largest part of the message that we are sending to others is \nmade up of non-verbal information. It is composed of our body language and our tone of voice. Figure 5 \nbelow demonstrates this fact. \n\n Figure 5: Face to Face Communication\n\n3.2 Face to Face Communication \n\nAlbert Mehrabian\u2019s work on verbal and non-verbal communication in the 1960s and early 1970s is \nstill considered a valid model today. He posed that the non-verbal aspects of communication such as \ntone of voice and non-verbal gestures communicate a great deal more than the words that are spoken. \nHe also found that people are more likely to believe your non-verbal communication than your verbal \ncommunication if the two are contradictory. In other words, you are most believable and most effectively \ncommunicating when all three elements of face-to-face communication are aligned with each other. \n\nOver half of the information we send to others is through \nnon-verbal methods.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n23 \n\nElements of Communication\n\n3.2.1 Tone of Voice \n\nAccording to Mehrabian, the tone of voice we use is responsible for about 35-40 percent of the message \nwe are sending. Tone involves the volume you use, the level and type of emotion that you communicate \nand the emphasis that you place on the words that you choose. To see how this works, try saying the \nsentences in Figure 6 with the emphasis each time on the word in bold.\n\nI didn\u2019t say he borrowed my book.\nI didn\u2019t say he borrowed my book.\nI didn\u2019t say he borrowed my book.\nI didn\u2019t say he borrowed my book.\nI didn\u2019t say he borrowed my book.\nI didn\u2019t say he borrowed my book.\nI didn\u2019t say he borrowed my book.\n\nFigure 6: Impact of Tone of Voice\n\nThe same sentence can have multiple meaning \ndepending on which word is emphasized. The emphasis \non a particular word implies additional information than \nwhat the words say.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/95f8cde3-50a6-4ae7-bfa0-a04600f54275\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n24 \n\nElements of Communication\n\nNotice that the meaning of the sentence changes each time, even though the words are the same. The \nemphasis you place on the word draws the listener\u2019s attention, indicating that the word is important \nsomehow. In this case, the emphasis indicates that the word is an error. So in the first example, I didn\u2019t \nsay he borrowed my book, the phrase includes the message that someone else said it. The implied \ninformation continues to change in each sentence, despite the words remaining the same each time. \n\n3.2.2 Body Language\n\nOver half of the message that we are sending to others is non-verbal, according to Mehrabian. This means \nthat we receive more than half of what a person is communicating through the subconscious messages \nthey are sending with body language. \n\nExamples of body language include: \n\n\u2022\t Facial expressions \n\u2022\t The way they are standing or sitting \n\u2022\t Any swaying or other movement \n\u2022\t Gestures with their arms or hands \n\u2022\t Eye contact (or lack thereof) \n\u2022\t Breathing rate \n\u2022\t Swallowing or coughing \n\u2022\t Blushing \n\u2022\t Fidgeting \n\nBasically, body language includes anything they are doing with their body besides speaking. We recognize \nthis communication instinctively, without having to be told what it means. Read the following examples \nand you\u2019ll have a good idea of what the person\u2019s body language is telling you. \n\nWe instinctively recognize what body language is telling us.\n\n\u2022\t Mike is sitting with his arms crossed over his chest. His head is tilted down and away from \nyou. His finger is tapping his arm in a fast, erratic manner. \n\n\u2022\t Jane is sitting back in her chair with her arms crossed behind her head. She is smiling at you \nand nodding her head from time to time as you speak. \n\n\u2022\t Dave is standing close to you at an angle. He is speaking just above a whisper and in a \nstrained voice. He makes quick, sharp movements with his hands. \n\n\u2022\t Marci is presenting to the marketing team. She is swaying back and forth, her hands keep \nchanging positions, and she seems to keep absent-mindedly touching her hair. \n\n\u2022\t Regina is sitting at the conference table in a meeting. Her legs are crossed and the leg that \nis on the floor is bouncing up and down at a rapid pace. She is sitting forward in her chair \nwith her pen tapping on the table. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n25 \n\nElements of Communication\n\nIt\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how you say it that matters the \nmost in relaying your message.\n\nWe can picture these people and their behaviors from the short description here and without hearing a \nword from them, we have a pretty good idea of how they are feeling about the situation or about what \nwe are saying to them.\n\nThere is another reason to understand body language besides being able to read what another is saying to \nyou subconsciously. You can use it to communicate intentionally that you are on the same wavelength as \nanother person. Next time you are in a conversation that you are enjoying or with whom it is important \nto you to make a good impression, notice their body language. Now notice yours. Chances are, you \nhave subconsciously mimicked their body language. If they lean forward, you lean forward. If they cross \none foot over their knee, you do the same. This is our automatic response to someone that we want to \nestablish a positive connection with \u2013 and it\u2019s one you can use to your advantage. \n\nBody language is a useful tool that you can learn to use. \n\nYou can mimic another\u2019s body language when you want \nto express support for them. \n\nYou can use a person\u2019s body language to realize that \nyour message is incomplete \u2013 there is more to say or \nthere are questions to be answered.\n\nWhen you are in a situation where you want to convey your support of another person, you can \nintentionally mimic their body language. If you are standing in the hallway and they lean to one side, \nmirror their action. If they sit back and relax, do the same. You are sending subconscious signals that \nyou are on their side, even if the topic that you are discussing is one where there may be disagreement. \nIt reaffirms that you are part of the same team, no matter what else might be going on. \n\nYou can also use this tool to gauge whether or not others are buying in on what you are saying. Are they \nusing words that express agreement, but sitting all wound up with crossed arms and legs? Unless they just \nhappen to be cold, chances are that there is some matter still unresolved in their mind. You can use this \nsignal as information to you that you still need to do some explaining or ask some additional questions. \n\n3.2.3 Verbal Communication \n\nThe third communication element is verbal communication. Believe it or not, it is actually the least \nimpactful element in face-to-face communication. The old adage is true \u2013 it\u2019s not what you say, it\u2019s how \nyou say it that counts. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n26 \n\nElements of Communication\n\nOf course, this is a bit simplified. We do want to use verbal communications, the words we choose, \nto our best advantage. You would definitely make a different impression if you curse during your \npresentation than if you don\u2019t. Choosing our words carefully is a way to enhance our message, but we \nshould remember that it is not the most important part of the message. We should not neglect to pay \nattention to the other non-verbal elements. \n\nBut what about when we are limited to using only verbal communication? Given that we know that \nface-to-face communication delivers the most complete message, we know that verbal communication \nalone can be challenging in creating effective communication. \n\nYou might think that talking on the telephone or sending off a quick email is an excellent time saver. \nThere are times when this is true. For example, when confirming specific facts or asking simple questions. \nBut for many communication needs, verbal communication only is rarely going to suffice. \n\nAs an example, imagine trying to give someone verbal instructions on how to draw the string of shapes \nshown in Figure 7. \n\nHow could you give someone directions on drawing \nthe string of shapes in Figure 7 by only using verbal \ncommunication? What would be challenging about doing \nso?\n\nwww.liu.se\/master\n\nStudy at Link\u00f6ping University\nand get the competitive edge!\nInterested in Computer Science and connected fields?

Would you give a general description of the string of shapes first? Would you \ntell them to be prepared to use rectangles, circles, triangles, and squares? Would you attempt to use \nmeasurements to give the other person the general idea of the size of each shape? Or would you just \ngive directions as to the general area to start and say \u2018draw a rectangle\u2019? \n\nIf you do try this with another person, chances are you will feel the strong desire to show them the \npicture or to use your hands to indicate the shapes and their position to one another. That\u2019s because in \nthis case, you instinctually know that there are better ways to deliver this type of communication. \n\nNotice that each of these ways of communicating the information is valid. They may end up with slightly \ndifferent results with the same person, but your challenge is in the fact that you are very limited in how \nyou communicate the information. Using only words, you are likely to end up with as many different \nversions of the drawing as there are people drawing it. We\u2019ll spend more time on improving your verbal \ncommunication in later chapters. \n\n3.3 Physical Communication\n\nAlthough it is less used in a business scenario, there is one last element of communication that all of us \nuse on a regular basis \u2013 physical communication. At work you might use it some \u2013 to pat someone on \nthe back or to give them a slight tap on the shoulder to get their attention. When it is used, it is more \neffective than verbal communication. \n\nTo clarify this point, imagine doing the exercise on the shapes in the last section, but this time, instead \nof words, you are able to put your hand over the hand of the person doing the drawing and direct the \nmotion of their pen physically. You will end up with something much closer to the actual picture than \nby verbal instruction alone. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n28 \n\nCommunication Styles\n\n4 Communication Styles\n4.1 Introduction \n\nEach one of us has a style of communicating that is unique. Some of us are talkative and extroverted while \nothers are quiet and reserved. Some of us are outspoken while others are less likely to share their opinions \nin public. Still others of us are formal and direct while others are informal and like to take our time getting \nto the main point. So how do these different styles of communication impact us in the workplace? \n\nCommunication style refers to the choices we tend \nto make when communicating to others. It involves \ntwo basic dimensions: the assertiveness level of our \ncommunication and the emotiveness level of our \ncommunication. We also use different styles depending \non with whom we are communicating. \n\nDifferences in communication style can lead to barriers in \ncommunication success.\n\nWhen you work with someone who has a decidedly different communication style from your own, \nthat difference can act as one of the barriers to effective communication. You may feel that someone is \nbeing aloof and cold while they feel that they are being quick and business-like. Or you might feel that \nsomeone is being too analytical and detailed, while they feel that you aren\u2019t recognizing the importance \nof the small things that can make a big difference. \n\nThere is a way to overcome these differences, however. It involves learning the basic characteristics of \nthe different communication styles and how they influence the context in which your communication \nis happening. If you can learn to understand the other person\u2019s communication style and how it is \nmanifesting itself in the way they communicate, you are learning your audience and what they need in \norder to understand your message. You can then encode your message in a way that they will be more \nlikely to be able to decode it, thereby increasing the chance that your message will be delivered successfully. \n\nTo put it another way, imagine that you are in a foreign country. You can stumble about, using your own \nwords for things and trying to communicate, with the result being that one or both parties may become \nfrustrated \u2013 and with very little chance that you will get the result that you want. \n\nBut if you can speak the language of the person you want to speak with, suddenly you can communicate. \nYou can ask for what you need, give them the information they need, and hopefully achieve the result \nthat is the original aim of your message. When you employ this communication tool, you simply make \nthe choice to communicate to your audience in their \u2018native tongue.\u2019 \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n29 \n\nCommunication Styles\n\nSo how do you start? You begin by studying the four basic communication styles and how they relate \nto each other. You identify your own personal communication style and what particular barriers you \nmight face when communicating with the other styles. Then you learn some simple tools you can use \nto enhance your communication with others, no matter what communication style they are. \n\n4.2 The Communication Styles Matrix\n\nThere are many different models that describe the ways in which we communicate. But one very useful \nmodel is based on the work of Dr. Eileen Russo. Her matrix is displayed in Figure 8 below. It shows that \nthere are two different dimensions in communication styles: the level of expressiveness and the level of \nassertiveness.\n\n Figure 8: The Communication Styles Matrix\n\nEach quadrant in Figure 8 represents a different communication style. People can fall anywhere within \neach quadrant, becoming more uniformly one style over the others as they move further from the center. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n30 \n\nCommunication Styles\n\nThe assertive communication styles tell others what to do \nwhile the less assertive styles ask others what should be \ndone. \n\nThe more expressive styles show emotion while the less \nexpressive styles refrain from showing it.\n\nNotice that the more assertive communication styles tend to \u2018tell\u2019 others what to do. The less assertive \ncommunication styles tend to \u2018ask\u2019 others what should be done. The more expressive communication \nstyles tend to show their emotions in their face, speech, and tone. The less expressive styles will either \nnot express their emotions or will work to hide them. The resulting four basic communication styles are \nshown in Figure 9. In the following sections, we\u2019ll look at the basic characteristics of each communication \nstyles and some things you can do to help you communication well with each type.\n\nLow Expressiveness + Low Assertiveness = Systematic\nLow Expressiveness + High Assertiveness = Direct\n\nHigh Expressiveness + High Assertiveness = Spirited\nHigh Expressiveness + Low Assertiveness = Considerate\n\nFigure 9: The Four Basic Communication Styles\n\nBy 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet\u2019s \nelectricity needs.

They tend to tell others what to do instead of asking others what they think \nshould be done, and they will not easily show emotions in their communications with others. Their \ncommunication style is meant to be expedient, though others may not always see it that way. They may \nappear terse and cold to others, who might take their style of communicating personally. \n\nPeople with direct communication styles are the \u2018go-\ngetters\u2019 in the group. They will work hard and fast and will \nbrook few questions or distractions. \n\nThese people need to use caution to avoid appearing \ndictatorial or cold. \n\nIf you are a direct style, you could probably use some \npractice with listening skills.\n\nDirect communicators will try to tell you as little as possible before moving on to the next topic \u2013 not \nbecause they are trying to be evasive, but because they are trying to save time. They won\u2019t always stop to \nlisten to others, even if the others have something valuable to contribute. They may seem impatient and \noverbearing at times, but it\u2019s not meant to be personal. They are attempting to focus on results rather \nthan emotions. They will speak their minds, even if it could be off-putting to others. Don\u2019t expect them \nto talk about their personal lives \u2013 they like to keep business and personal issues separate. They don\u2019t \nback down from conflict, and at times could be seen as being aggressive rather than assertive in the \nway that they express their opinions.

They are the dreamers, \nthe inventors, and the innovators in the group. Their communication may be full of grand ideas and \nhyperboles that tend to be very persuasive to others at first. \n\nPeople with the spirited communication style love \nto flesh out ideas, brainstorm, and talk about the big \npicture \u2013 as long as they get to do a lot of the talking! \n\nSpirited people can have a hard time nailing down the \ndetails in their wonderful ideas. They may also have a \nhard time sticking to an agenda or to one topic.\n\nHowever, they are not always very good at discussing the details or the exact steps in the process. They \nwill tend to go off on tangents in their conversations, and like to interject anecdotes into their dialogues \nin order to demonstrate or drive home a point.\n\nKeeping to an agenda is sometimes a challenge for those with the spirited communication style since \nboth time management and remaining focused are challenges for this group. Their written or verbal \ncommunication may tend towards the dramatic.

Expect to use and appreciate logic when you communicate with a systematic. They will \nappreciate facts and analysis rather than the \u2018big picture\u2019 ideas that have not yet been proved useful. \n\nPeople with a systematic communication style will focus \non facts over opinions. Communication with tangible \nevidence is best for systematic. They will likely be \nuncomfortable expressing feelings and will tend to avoid \nconfrontation.\n\nThey may be slower to respond to your communication, as they are probably analyzing the situation \nand constructing a logical, well thought-out response. Charts, graphs and trends are all useful tools for \ncommunicating with systematic as well. \n\nThose with a systematic communication style are uncomfortable with expressing their feelings about \nthings and do not like conflict. They may tend to shut down communication rather than dealing with \nemotional or confrontational situations. If you give them directions, you will need to be very thorough \nand precise in relaying them. \n\nThe more information you can give them, the happier they will be \u2013 as long as the information is relevant \nto the current discussion or is relevant background information.

They \nwant to please other people and to be included in their peer group. They like to work with others, help \nothers, and connect to others on a personal level. If there is conflict in your group, they will be the ones \nto attempt to mediate it. They want everyone to have the chance to speak their minds, have their turns, \nand receive recognition for their contribution. They are natural trainers and counselors, and enjoy helping \nothers to succeed. They will encourage group collaboration and communication, though they are not \nalways inclined to speak their own minds. \n\nPeople with a considerate communication style will be \nvery interested in listening and in finding out how you \nand others are doing. They will want everyone to have a \nchance to speak, but might refrain from expressing their \nown opinions if they think it will displease others.\n\nThis is the major communication challenge for those with the considerate personality style \u2013 they may \nbe reluctant to share an opposing opinion, even if it\u2019s important information, because they are concerned \nabout keeping the peace and being liked. \n\nThey are also inclined to take direct communication as a personal matter. It\u2019s difficult for them to separate \nother peoples\u2019 opinions about a topic from their opinions about them, and so may feel that an opposing \nopinion is due to not liking them. There is also the possibility that they will be talked into something in \norder to preserve the peace rather than standing their ground.

Hopefully you recognized the people in your office in the descriptions of the different \ncommunication styles in the last section. If not, you can pay more attention to how they communicate \nwith you as a sign of their main communication style. Remember too that not everyone fits neatly into a \ncategory; some people will bridge more than one style, depending on with whom they are communicating. \nYou may need to do some experimenting to determine which communication style works best with them. \n\nIt will also take practice for you to become comfortable in altering your own communication style or \nmethods in order to best communicate with others. You will still be inclined to your natural communication \nstyle, which is to be expected. It will also be easier to do at first when you have the time to think about \nyour communication ahead of time, such as when writing an email. However, over time, you will find that \nyou can adjust faster and employ the tools that you need without thinking it out ahead of time. \n\n4.3.1 Direct Style \n\nWhen communicating with someone who has the direct communication style, the key is to get to the \nmain point of your communication as soon as possible, and to do so in as efficient as manner as possible. \nThe first example below shows the type of communication that will not work with someone who has a \ndirect communication style. In this example, Jane is the one with the direct communication style. \n\nHi Jane, \n\nI heard from Alex that you landed a new large business account yesterday. He said that you did \nan excellent job in explaining the company\u2019s benefits to the customer and that you were very \nprofessional. \n\nAlex also said that the customer asked for a quote on a new phone system for his existing offices. \nHave you thought about how you will proceed? Let me know if I can help you get the quote \ntogether or if you need any ideas on the configuration. I\u2019d like to get the quote to them later this \nweek if you think you can manage it. That way we would have a good chance of getting the order \nin for this month\u2019s numbers. \n\nThanks again, and hope you are having a good Tuesday so far! \n\nAnne \n\nWhat is the main point of the communication? What is the requested action? How much of the \ncommunication is superfluous information? \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n38 \n\nCommunication Styles\n\nA person with a direct communication style will not necessarily glean what you want them to do or by \nwhen. They will appreciate the accolade, but they won\u2019t appreciate the personal references or information. \n\nJane, \n\nGreat job on the new account. I\u2019d like to meet for 10\u201315 minutes tomorrow to discuss strategy \nand timing. Please let me know if you\u2019d prefer to meet at 1:00, 1:30, or 2:00 p.m. \n\nThank you, \n\nAnne \n\nSee the difference? The first one does eventually get around to the point, but it is too personal-sounding \nand doesn\u2019t give a clear request for the direct person to respond to. The second one still communicates \napproval and makes a request, but it does so in a much clearer way. If it seems curt to you, don\u2019t worry \u2013 \nthe direct style person will appreciate it. It\u2019s a perfectly professional communication and there is much \nless chance for misunderstanding. \n\n4.3.2 Spirited Style \n\nWhen communicating with someone who is spirited, it might be hard to even pin them down for \ncommunication in the first place. And once you have their attention, keeping it is another matter \nentirely. You will find that consistency is important in communicating with people who are spirited. \nIf you can get them used to a particular format or method of communication, it will be easier to keep \nthem communicating. This doesn\u2019t mean always choosing email or always choosing telephone. But it \ndoes mean always using follow-up questions or checking in on a regular basis to see if you are both still \non the same page. \n\nAlso remember that a person with a spirited style may need more time to brainstorm and discuss ideas \nthan the other communication styles. If you want them to come to the table with decisions already made, \nbe sure to get their buy-in beforehand. Otherwise they may still find the need to discuss something that \nyou already felt was decided. \n\nFinally, you can go a long way towards relationship-building with a spirited style person if you give them \nthe opportunity to shine. Does your team need to make a presentation? Let the spirited person know \nthat you think they would be a good choice to lead. Complimenting them in a public arena is a good \nchoice as well. Here\u2019s an example of a good written communication to a spirited person. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n39 \n\nCommunication Styles\n\nHi Sally! \n\nI thought your presentation yesterday was fantastic! I enjoyed the way that you had the audience \nparticipate in the session. \n\nI think you would be a great choice for the educational component at our next board meeting. \nThe Board of Directors needs some information about local economic trends, but in a way that \nis not too boring or complicated. \n\nWould you like to have lunch to discuss it? I\u2019m free on Thursday or Friday this week. Let me know \nif either of those days will work for you. \n\nThanks so much! \n\nGeorge\n\nWhy would this communication work for a spirited person? It is enthusiastic, complimentary, and would \nbe flattering to Sally. She will be pleased that you noticed her first presentation and more pleased that \nyou would like her to repeat it.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/7df08111-c180-4bd8-97db-a2d500e6043a\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n40 \n\nCommunication Styles\n\nOr course, you\u2019re sure to have a very excited person on your hands at lunch. So be prepared. You could \nbring an outline of the topics you want to cover at the presentation. Ask for her input and make sure \nyou\u2019ve planned enough time to let her give it. Then help her narrow the ideas down and note them \ndown for her. Sending a follow-up email or note will help ensure that you are both on the same page \nas well. Remember, the spirited person is very valuable for all their talents and enthusiasm \u2013 so with a \nlittle structure around your communications you can be successful in communicating without stifling \nthe very qualities they bring to the table. \n\n4.3.3 Systematic Style \n\nWhen you need to communicate with a person who has the systematic communication style, remember \nthat facts are what to emphasize. Opinions are not going to be very effective. Use logical, linear thinking \nand communicate in the same way. Step them through your thinking \u2013 don\u2019t jump ahead of any steps. \nIt will save you time in the long run if you take the time to explain your argument or thoughts through \nthe first time. \n\nIf you need a systematic to make a decision, let data do the talking for you as much as possible. Have \ncharts? Know some trends? Have examples to show how something works? All of these can be useful \nin communicating with a systematic person. If you are attempting to encourage a systematic to support \nan idea that is not supported by the data, you will be in for a bit of a challenge. However, you can still \nget their help if you can logically explain your position. \n\nRemember too that systematic types are not prone to sharing personal information with work colleagues. \nYou shouldn\u2019t take this personally \u2013 it\u2019s simply what they prefer. Yet if they do broach a personal subject \nwith you, you can usually take it as a sign that they feel more comfortable with you than others. \n\nThe example of how not to communicate with a direct communication style person is a good example of \nhow not to communicate with someone of a systematic style as well. You could also avoid phrases like: \n\n\u2022\t It\u2019s my opinion that\u2026\n\u2022\t I believe that\u2026\n\u2022\t I feel that\u2026\n\nInstead, try using phrases like: \n\n\u2022\t The data shows that\u2026\n\u2022\t The trends show that\u2026\n\u2022\t The results of the test show\u2026\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n41 \n\nCommunication Styles\n\nThe chart below gives more suggestions for language that will work better with systematics: \n\nInstead of\u2026 Use\u2026\n\nSome, many, the majority of 20%, three out of five, an average of 2.7\n\nNext week Thursday at 3:00 p.m.\n\nASAP By tomorrow at noon\n\nIn a timely manner Within two weeks\n\nThey Gail, Amy, and Wes\n\nAn upward trend An increase of 12% over five years\n\nEventually When the following conditions have been met: \n\nFigure 18: Suggestions for Language to Use with Systematics\n\n4.3.4 Considerate Style \n\nTo best communicate with someone who is a considerate communication style, remember that the \nperson\u2019s feelings are going to be important. They will listen best when you make them feel as if their \nfeelings are important to you, their opinion is important to you, and that you value them as a team member \nand a contributor. This doesn\u2019t mean that you have to become very emotionally expressive yourself, but \nshowing in interest in them as an individual will go a long way. Why not start your communication \nwith an inquiry into how their child is doing, or how their last vacation was? The small investment of \nyour time can have a great return. \n\nIf you have something to communicate that will perhaps be perceived as a critical, you will need to tread \ncautiously in order to be effective. Let the person know that you appreciate their work, and name the \naspects that you find valuable and good. Then note the changes that need to be made, explaining the \nreason for the changes as much as you can. Smile, and use open body language to let them know that \nthere is nothing personal in what is being said. Whenever possible, use requests instead of imperatives \nin discussing the needed changes. \n\nFor considerate style people, the example of used as how not to speak to a direct style person is actually \na good one to use for a considerate style. It builds to the point easily, it shows care for the other person, \nand it makes a request in a friendly, personal manner. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n42 \n\nBasic Listening Skills\n\n5 Basic Listening Skills\n\n5.1 Introduction \n\nGood listeners are rare these days. Studies have shown that most listeners retain less than 50% of what \nthey hear. Imagine what that means when it comes to a conversation that you might have with your boss, \na colleague, or a customer. If you speak for ten minutes, chances are that you have only heard about half \nof that conversation \u2013 and so have they. No wonder miscommunications happen so frequently! \n\nYet listening is one of the most vital skills that you need if you want to communicate effectively. \nListening allows you to \u2018decode\u2019 the messages that you are receiving, but it also allows you to help others \ncommunicate better. When you aren\u2019t certain of the message that you have heard the first time, listening \nwell allows you to ask the questions that will clarify the message. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/229ffd82-96d7-e011-adca-22a08ed629e5\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n43 \n\nBasic Listening Skills\n\nOf course, listening is important in more arenas than in the work place. We listen for multiple reasons: \n\n\u2022\t To build relationships \n\u2022\t To understand others \n\u2022\t To be entertained\n\u2022\t To learn \n\u2022\t To show empathy \n\u2022\t To gather information \n\nWith as much as listening can do for us, it\u2019s obvious that we can all benefit from improving our listening \nskills. We can become more productive at work, more connected in our relationships, and more efficient \nin everything that we do. But listening also helps us to persuade and negotiate with others. It can help \nus avoid misunderstandings and can just make life more conflict-free in general. All of these are very \ngood reasons for learning more about how to be a better listener. \n\n5.2 Self-Awareness\n\nAn important tool for becoming a good listener is becoming aware of your own behavior, feelings, \nand habits when listening. Do you know whether or not you are a good listener? Are you only a good \nlistener in certain situations, like when listening to a friend who is upset? Or can you also listen in a \ntense situation when you have to communicate with someone who is angry, stressed, or expressing an \nopposing opinion to your own? \n\nTake time to become aware of your own listening behavior in different scenarios. At work, at home, with \nfriends, with strangers, or with other groups that you communicate with, notice the following: \n\n\u2022\t Your body language \u2013 how are you standing or sitting? Are you tense or relaxed? In an open \nposition or a closed one? \n\n\u2022\t Do you make eye contact? Do you keep it? Or do you look away, look down, or turn your \neyes to other people or things in your environment? \n\n\u2022\t Are you following every word? Could you repeat what was just said verbatim? Or is your \nmind wandering off to lunch, that email you need to write, or that phone call you just had? \n\n\u2022\t Are you planning what you will say in return? \n\nAll of these behaviors make it difficult to be a good listener. You may be sending the message to the \nspeaker that their message is unimportant \u2013 or worse, that they are unimportant. As you practice better \nlistening skills, you\u2019ll need to be able to recognize when you\u2019re straying back to these old behaviors. \nBeing self-aware will let you self-correct and get better and better at listening to others. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n44 \n\nBasic Listening Skills\n\n5.3 Active Listening \n\nBecoming a better listener requires improving your active listening skills. What is meant by active \nlistening skills? Most of us spend at least part of the time that we are listening waiting for the person to \nstop so that we can have our next turn. This is particularly true when a conversation is heated or when \nthe information we are trying to convey is very important. \n\nActive listening means being as attentive and involved in the conversation during the times that you \nare listening as when you are speaking. You must learn to be consciously attentive to the words that are \nbeing said, but in addition, to the whole message that the other person is attempting to relay to you. In \norder to do this you must pay close attention to the speaker. \n\nThis requires concentration and practice. It means being certain that you either eliminate or ignore the \ndistractions surrounding you, and that you don\u2019t spend the whole time coming up with your response \nto what they are saying. This may sound difficult, but there are some simple tools you can use to make \nactive listening a regular habit. \n\n5.3 Becoming an Active Listener \n\nThere are five key aspects of becoming an active listener. You will probably already be employing some of \nthem, but may need to practice others. However, once you are using these tools over time, you will find \nthat they get easier and easier. Plus, you\u2019ll learn so much about others and have such better conversations \nthat you will be positively reinforced each time you practice. \n\n1. Pay close attention.\nWith this step, you learn to give the speaker your undivided attention. But you also let the speaker \nknow that you are listening by using acknowledgements \u2013 types of verbal and non-verbal tools \nthat help add proof that you are truly listening.\n\n\u2022\t Look the speaker in the eyes\n\u2022\t Stop any mental chatter\n\u2022\t Don\u2019t start preparing your response or rebuttal while the other person is talking\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n45 \n\nBasic Listening Skills\n\n\u2022\t Make sure your environment doesn\u2019t distract you\n\u2022\t Notice the speaker\u2019s body language and tone of voice \u2013 what are the non-verbal messages \n\ntelling you?\n\u2022\t If you are in a group, avoid side conversations\n\n2.

Check that you heard the message correctly by \nsaying things like \u201cwhat I hear you saying is\u2026.\u201d or \u201cIf I\u2019m hearing you correctly, you\u2019re \nsaying\u2026.\u201d or \u201cI think you\u2019re talking about\u2026\u201d. \n\n\u2022\t Ask questions that will help clarify the speaker\u2019s meaning. Suggestions include things \nlike, \u201cCan you tell me more about\u2026?\u201d or \u201cWhat did you mean when you said\u2026?\u201d or \u201cI \nthink you\u2019re saying\u2026is that right?\u201d \n\n\u2022\t Summarize what you\u2019ve heard occasionally \u2013 don\u2019t wait until the end or you might not \nremember exactly what was said. \n\n4. Don\u2019t interrupt! \n\nThere is nothing good that comes from interrupting the speaker. You will only be limiting your \nchance of understanding the message because you won\u2019t hear it all \u2013 and because the speaker \nwill get frustrated! \n\n5. Respond Appropriately. \n\nWhen you are actively listening, you are showing your respect for the speaker, as well as gaining \nthe information that you need to form your response. Once you have that information and \nhave clarified it, it\u2019s time to form your reply. When expressing your thoughts:\n\n\u2022\t Be honest and open\n\u2022\t Be respectful \n\u2022\t Be thorough\n\nRemember too that you are modeling excellent behavior for others when you use active listening. Don\u2019t \nbe surprised to hear others start to use clarifying questions or reflecting phrases as well \u2013 which would \nbe a good thing for everyone concerned! \n\n5.4 Listening in Difficult Situations \n\nListening is particularly difficult when you are in a heated or emotionally charged situation. In order for \nyour communication to be successful and productive, you may need to employ some additional tools in \norder to listen to others and to allow for the exchange of information despite your feelings. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n47 \n\nBasic Listening Skills\n\nSome tips include: \n\n\u2022\t If possible, suggest that you move the discussion to a private location with no distractions. \n\u2022\t If tension is high, start by agreeing on what your goal of the discussion will be. Are you \n\nresolving a problem? Learning about what happened in a difficult situation? Deciding roles \nin an important project? Determining how to proceed in order to reach a deadline? Come \nup with a common goal that you can both agree to work towards and that you can both \nrefer back to should the conversation go off-topic. \n\n\u2022\t If you need to, set ground rules. These could include agreeing that you won\u2019t bring up old \nevents again, that you will keep personal comments out of the discussion, or that you will \nboth keep your voices down. \n\n\u2022\t While listening, remind yourself of the active listening guidelines. Breathe slowly in and out \nin order to remain calm. \n\n\u2022\t If you can\u2019t seem to pay attention, try repeating to yourself in your mind every word that \nthe other person says. Then you are \u2018hearing\u2019 the message twice and it has a better chance of \ngetting through. \n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd!\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\"\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd#$%\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd&'())%\ufffd*+\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\t\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd,\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd-\n\n.\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\t\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\t\n\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\r\ufffd\ufffd\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\n The Wake\nthe only emission we want to leave behind\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/4ba133ea-6153-46a2-ad8f-9fef00f222a0\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n48 \n\nEffective Written Communication\n\n6 Effective Written \nCommunication \n\n6.1 Introduction\n\nIn today\u2019s world of rapid-fast communication via texts and emails, most of us would rather shoot off \na written message than make a phone call. It\u2019s fast, efficient when used properly, and it provides a nice \ndocument trail for our work records. Written communication is more important than ever, yet very few \npeople know when writing is the right \u2013 or wrong \u2013 form of communication, and fewer still can write \nwell. Of course, like all other communication skills, good writing skills can be learned. \n\n6.2 When and When Not to Use Written Communication \n\nSure, sending an email is easy. How many of us haven\u2019t written one while on hold with another call \nor in those few moments between one meeting and the next? Texts are even easier \u2013 and let you send \ninformation from virtually anywhere. \n\nYet when is written communication most effective, and when is it not? There are a number of factors \nthat can help you make that choice. \n\n6.2.1 Complexity of the Topic \n\nUsing written communication is an excellent choice for sharing information that is easily organized and \neasily understood by the independent reader. This means that the reader can read the communication \nand get the message clearly without additional information from you or other sources. Meeting notices, \nanswers to quick questions, or quick clarifications are all easy to complete with written communication. \n\nHighly complex topics or lengthy explanations are not \ngood choices for normal written communication. Written \ncommunication should \u2018stand alone\u2019 for the reader.\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n49 \n\nEffective Written Communication\n\nHowever, there is a point at which written communication becomes inefficient for one of several reasons. \nThe information may be too complex to organize in a manner that will be intelligible to your reader \nwithout further assistance. \n\nThe amount of explanation required to make the information intelligible might be cumbersome, leading \nto misinterpretation or lack of understanding. In the long run, you\u2019ll end up answering so many follow-\nup emails or phone calls that in these cases you would have been better off having a face-to-face meeting \nor in a formal training session. \n\n6.2.2 Amount of \u2018Discussion\u2019 Required \n\nIf the topic is complex or involved enough that there will need to be a long exchange of discussion-type \nemails, the longer you allow the exchange to continue in writing, the more you are risking that someone \nwill misunderstand. Furthermore, you can\u2019t be assured that everyone who received the email has actually \nhad the chance to participate in the discussion unless you are able to track the receipt of others\u2019 emails or \nrequire everyone to respond one way or the other. Therefore, decision making, long, involved explanations \nor conversations, or controversial subjects are not usually good topics for written communication. \n\nLengthy discussions by written communication (email) are \nnot efficient, and each exchange risks meaning getting \nlost.\n\n6.2.3 Shades of Meaning \n\nWe\u2019ve learned from previous information in this ebook that non-verbal communication is the most \nimportant form of communication in getting your message delivered. When you are writing, you are \nleft to the small portion of communication that is possible through words alone in getting your message \nthrough to your reader. So the more intense the emotions around a topic or the more important the \nmessage is, the less likely writing will be a successful form of communicating. \n\nWritten communication alone does not allow for non-\nverbal communication \u2013 the most important aspect of \ngetting your meaning across.\n\nFor example, it can be difficult to convey tone of voice, humor, sarcasm, or other shades of meaning \nin writing alone. Don\u2019t risk offending someone or causing confusion by someone not understanding \nyour true meaning by trusting written communication with the task of conveying highly emotional or \nimportant information. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n50 \n\nEffective Written Communication\n\n6.2.4 Formal Communication \n\nAlthough there are exceptions, written communication is still the common choice when the level of \nformality between two parties is high. For example, think about your customers or clients. Chances are \nthat formal communication such as contract terms, sales agreements, account information, or other legal \nor administrative information will be transmitted in written form. This gives you both the information in \na format that you can pass on as needed, and gives you both reference material to help you in continuing \nyour communication. As the level of formality decreases in the relationship, you are more likely to move \nfrom paper documentation to email communication as well. \n\nThe higher the level of formality of communication, the \nmore likely you will use written communication. Plus, you \nwill usually employ email more as the level of formality \ndecreases.\n\n6.3 Writing Effectively \n\nAlthough some of the following information relates to either email or paper communication, it is mainly \ngeared towards email since so much of our work involves email. However, you can apply most of the \nadvice to paper communication as well. \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nMaersk.com\/Mitas\n\n\ufffde Graduate Programme  \nfor Engineers and Geoscientists\n\nMonth 16\nI was a construction\n\nsupervisor in  \nthe North Sea  \n\nadvising and  \nhelping foremen  \n\nsolve problems\n\nI was a\n\nhe\ns\n\nReal work  \nInternational opportunities \n\n\ufffdree work placements\nal Internationa\nor\ufffdree wo\n\nI wanted real responsibili\ufffd \n I joined MITAS because  \n\nwww.discovermitas.com\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/9da50518-808b-41b3-9e08-9fe200fbad87\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n51 \n\nEffective Written Communication\n\n6.3.1 Subject Lines \n\nWhen you are writing a letter or an email, the subject line of the communication is like the headline in \na newspaper. It calls your attention to the communication and should also let you know what it is about. \nThe best subject lines will also tell you what needs to be done \u2013 and will let the recipient prioritize which \nemails to open first and which ones to ignore for later (or altogether!) \n\nWhat do these subject lines tell you about the information that will follow? \n\n\u2022\t Response to Your Email \n\u2022\t Question \n\u2022\t Hello\n\u2022\t Meeting \n\u2022\t Information for you \n\nBy these subject lines, can you tell any information about what will follow? Sure, the first one could be \nclear if the receiver has only written one email that day. But most of us handle dozens, if not hundreds, \nof emails every week. It\u2019s unlikely the receiver will remember exactly what you are responding to. \n\nThe other subject lines are too general. They don\u2019t specify what information will be contained or what \naction the recipient needs to take. If there is important or urgent information included, it might go \nunread \u2013 or opened, scanned, and dismissed. \n\nInstead, try subject lines such as: \n\n\u2022\t Information on Open House Tuesday, June 22, 2010 \u2013 Please RSVP! \n\u2022\t Question Regarding the Change in Health Benefits \u2013 Response Needed\n\u2022\t Meeting Requested on New Website Design \u2013 Please Confirm Availability\n\u2022\t URGENT! Change in On-Call Schedule for Memorial Day Weekend\n\u2022\t Response to Your Question on the Marketing Plan for 3rd Quarter\n\nEach of these tells the reader what information they will find when they open the email, and also tells \nthem whether or not they need to take action. The reader can decide which of these is most important \nand process the incoming emails in the best order. \n\n6.3.2 Put the Main Point First \n\nWhen you write your communication, you need to know exactly what, why, and to whom you are \nwriting. Are you simply giving information, asking for information, or requesting the other person to \ntake an action? If you can\u2019t narrow down the point, you either aren\u2019t ready to write or writing isn\u2019t the \nright choice of communication formats to use. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n52 \n\nEffective Written Communication\n\nOnce you know what the main point of your email is, you should put that first in the communication. \nWe all tend to scan written communication to save time, focusing more at the top of the information \nthan the bottom. Putting your main information at the top of the communication pulls the reader\u2019s \nattention to the main topic, request or instruction. You can follow with background information after \nyou\u2019ve stated the reason for writing \u2013 but if you start with the background information, you risk your \nreader missing the point of the communication. \n\nHere\u2019s a bad example: \n\nDear Tom, \n\nI spent some time with Joan this morning reviewing the numbers from last quarter\u2019s sales results. \nI was concerned to see that there seems to be a downward trend in sales of the Widget Deluxe, \nwhich is significantly different from what we forecasted. I am concerned that this might have an \nimpact on our launch of the Widget Super Deluxe planned for next quarter. I think we should \nmeet with the marketing team and the sales team to see if we can identify any possible issues \nwith the sales and fulfillment process that we could influence. Would you let me know when you \nare available this week? \n\nThanks, \n\nJulie \n\nNotice the subject line? Again, it\u2019s not precise. Then the writer doesn\u2019t get to the point of the communication \nuntil the last line. If the reader is scanning for information, he might not even get to the last line before \nmoving on to the next email. If that happens, you\u2019ll have to write another communication or follow-up \nwith a phone call \u2013 which is a waste of your time. \n\nNow read this version: \n\nSubject: Request to Meet with You Regarding Sales Process \u2013 Please Respond \n\nDear Tom, \n\nI\u2019d like to meet with you, the sales team, and the marketing team this week to discuss the impact of \nthe latest sales trends on the launch of Widget Super Deluxe. Would you be available on Monday \nat 3 p.m. for about an hour? \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n53 \n\nEffective Written Communication\n\nI spent some time with Joan this morning reviewing the numbers from last quarter\u2019s sales results. \nI was concerned to see that there seems to be a downward trend in sales of the Widget Deluxe, \nwhich is significantly different from what we forecasted. I think we should attempt to identify any \npossible issues with the sales and fulfillment process. \n\nThanks, \n\nJulie \n\nSee the difference? The second email has a clear subject line that asks for a response. It gets to the point \nin the first paragraph. Even if the reader is scanning the information, he will have a better chance of \ngetting the message. \n\n6.3.3 Know Your Audience\n\nWhen you are writing a communication, you need to be able to identify to whom you are writing. Sure, \nyou could be writing to the \u2018world\u2019 of your organization or the \u2018world\u2019 of all of your customers, but you \nneed to know what it is that they will gain from your communication. Is it just information for everyone, \nor are there particular unidentified members of the audience who need to receive your communication, \nrecognize the information that is important to them, and then take a specific action? \n\nwww.job.oticon.dk\n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/count\/advert\/0e9efd82-96d7-e011-adca-22a08ed629e5\n\n\nDownload free eBooks at bookboon.com\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n54 \n\nEffective Written Communication\n\nFor example, say you are changing the HMO healthcare plan at the office so that domestic partners are \nnow eligible for coverage. You might be sending the communication to everyone in your organization, \nbut your true audience is employees that have domestic partners. In thinking about those people, what \ninformation do they need? What choices do they need to make? What concerns might they have in \nacting on the information? How can you handle those concerns in your communication? Identifying \nyour audience helps you target and fine tune the communication in order to make it as effective as \npossible. \n\nAnother aspect of knowing your audience is being aware of what they don\u2019t know. Most of us have a \n\u2018lingo\u2019 that we use in the day to day operations of our work. They might be technical terms, references to \ninternal structures or teams, or acronyms that are shared among peers. However, you need to be certain \nthat every member of your audience would understand that lingo or acronym before using it \u2013 and that \nevery person they might forward your communication to would also understand it. When in doubt, add \na brief explanation or spell it out. \n\n6.3.4 Organization of the Message \n\nPerhaps your communication has more than one request or call to action. If the actions are unrelated \nto each other, the best choice is to send a separate email for each one. That requires your reader to see \neach topic in the subject line and then to respond accordingly. \n\nHowever, you might have situations where you have several requests or several important facts for the \nreader. In that case, you need to organize the information in a way that increases the chance that the \nreader will give you all of the information or take all of the actions that you request. You can do this \nby using topic headings that still put the main topic of the communication at the top such as: Response \nNeeded, Background, Concerns. Or RSVP Requested, Instructions, Directions, FAQs. You could also \nuse bullets or numbers for each subtopic. Or consider using bold or colored font to highlight requested \nactions. One word of caution \u2013 avoid using all capital letters, which can be interpreted as \u2018yelling\u2019. \n\nYour job is to make it easy and fool-proof for your reader to get your message. Use whatever tools \nyou can employ to ensure that the message is delivered fully, as long as they are still professional and \nappropriate for your audience. \n\nhttp:\/\/bookboon.com\/\n\n\nClick on the ad to read more\n\nEffective Communication Skills\n\n55 \n\nResources\n\n7 Resources\nMindtools.com.
